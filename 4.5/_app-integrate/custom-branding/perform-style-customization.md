Using style customization you can create a uniform ThoughtSpot experience that
matches with your company's look and feel. To re-brand the interface, you can
use the style customization option found on the Admin section in the ThoughtSpot
web application. It lets you change the logo, application background color,
chart color palettes, and footer text. For help with chart and table
visualization fonts, contact ThoughtSpot support.

This is especially useful if you're using the ThoughtSpot APIs for embedding
visualizations from ThoughtSpot in your own web portal or application. You can
make the visualizations match the look and feel of the portal or application in
which they are embedded. For more information on using the APIs, see the
ThoughtSpot Application Integration Guide.

To enable style customization, contact ThoughtSpot Support. The ThoughtSpot logo
in the middle of the page is automatically removed when Style Customization is
enabled.

## Change style customization

Make changes to the style of your ThoughtSpot interface in the **Style Customization** page. This option gives you defined, yet impactful capabilities for re-branding the interface, so having some understanding of typography and color schemes would be helpful.

To re-brand the interface:

1. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click on the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin_icon.png)

3. In the **Admin** panel, click on **Style Customization**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/style_customization.png "Style Customization menu")

    Once in the menu page, you can:

    -   [Upload application logos](upload-application-logos.html#)
    -   [Set chart and table visualization fonts](set-chart-and-table-visualization-fonts.html#)
    -   [Choose a background color](choose-background-color.html#)
    -   [Select chart color palettes](select-chart-color-palettes.html#)
    -   [Change the footer text](change-the-footer-text.html#).
