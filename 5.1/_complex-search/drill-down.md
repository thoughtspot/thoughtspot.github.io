Drilling down allows you to see more information about the columns used within
your search. If you own the pinboard you can drill down to the data beneath.
Users you share the pinboard with can also drill down provide they _also_
have access to the data on which the board was based.

To drill down:

1. Right-click the visualization or table cell of interest, and select **Drill down**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/drill_down.png "Drill down option")

2. Click any of the listed data to recreate the search with that data included.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/drill_down_list.png "Drill down list")
