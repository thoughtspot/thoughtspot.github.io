There are several system monitoring pinboards in ThoughtSpot that provide
answers for system status and resource usage questions. The information in these
pinboards are updated hourly from internal data sources that collect monitoring
statistics.

 They are based on worksheets, which administrators can view, but not modify.
 However, you can create new monitoring pinboards from the worksheets.

## About deprecated boards

The deprecated boards (`TS status: Usage - Deprecated` and `TS StaTS: Queries --
Deprecated`) are there to support older installations. New installations, should
not use or rely on deprecated boards. Older installations that have used these
boards in some way, should use the new boards and remove any dependencies.
