When you enter a TQL statement, the system warns you of possible dependency
consequences with a prompt asking if you’d like to proceed. This should make you
feel safe issuing TQL commands, even commands like dropping a table.

If TQL is run using the flag `--allow_unsafe`, your statements will always
execute without this warning. Note that when running TQL from a script, you will
need to decide what behavior you want if the script contains changes that affect
dependent objects. If you want the script to run even if objects with
dependencies are affected, run it using this flag, for example:

```
cat safest_script_ever.sql | tql --allow_unsafe
```

If you do not run the script using the flag, it will fail if any of its commands
might cause problems with dependent objects.

TQL actions with possible dependency consequences include:

-   Change, add, or remove a primary key.
    -   When changing or adding a primary key, if the key in question is not unique in the data it may cause deletion of rows, because of upserts occurring when duplicate primary keys are found.
    -   When changing or removing a primary key, incoming foreign key relationships will be broken.
-   Change a column datatype.
-   Add a relationship or foreign key.
-   Drop a relationship or foreign key constraint.
-   Change or add a sharding key.
-   Drop a table, schema, or database.

When issuing one of the previous commands, you will see a warning message similar to this:

```
TQL> ALTER TABLE table1
     DROP CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY;

WARNING: This operation will break the Foreign Key relationship “products”
with table “sales”, which will break 34 user-visible visualizations and
2 Worksheets. We recommend taking a snapshot before performing this operation.
Do you wish to proceed? (yes/no).
```
