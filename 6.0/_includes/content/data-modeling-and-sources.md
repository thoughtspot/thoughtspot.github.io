You can change the data modeling settings for base **Tables**, **Worksheets**,
and **[Views]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/about-query-on-query.html)**.
Worksheets will inherit the data modeling settings from the tables upon which
they are based. However, if you make further changes to a base table _after_
you've created worksheets on it, the new data model changes will not propagate
up. You must make any new data model changes directly to the worksheets
(if you want them).
