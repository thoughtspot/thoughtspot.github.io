<meta name="description" content="You can view system and usage information for your ThoughtSpot cluster from the TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard. This Pinboard contains several charts and tables that track monthly active users, top Pinboards by number of views, today’s users, and so on. To view this Pinboard, search for it in the Pinboards tab. Understand the TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard The TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard page consists of standard ThoughtSpot Answers that update in real time and rely on internal system data. The Answers rely on underlying system worksheets, which are available to ThoughtSpot administrators. The information in these worksheets updates hourly from internal tables that collect monitoring statistics. The more options menu for the Answers in this Pinboard contains fewer options than the traditional menu. You can SpotIQ analyst, download, edit, or present the Answer. When you edit the Answer, you see the query that ThoughtSpot built the Answer on. You can also copy the Answer’s embed link, use Answer Explorer on the Answer, or interact with the Answer by drilling down. While you can interact with and change a copied version of the Answer, you cannot save changes to the underlying query. The following charts, tables, and panels are available on the TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard: cluster summary, critical alerts, monthly active users, monthly ad-hoc searches, monthly Pinboard views,, top users last month, top Pinboards last month, ad-hoc search by user, today’s users, and configuration events. Cluster Summary This system panel contains basic information about your cluster. The NUMBER OF NODES is the number of installed nodes. This doesn’t reflect the active nodes which may be more or less. This summary includes the LAST SNAPSHOT TIME it reflects whether regular snapshots of your cluster are collected. This value should update regularly in real time. If you do not see it change or empty, you should check your cluster snapshot policy using the tscli command: $ tscli snapshot-policy show schedule { period { number: 1 unit: HOUR } retention_policy { bucket { time { number: 1 unit: HOUR } capacity: 3 } bucket { time { number: 4 unit: HOUR } capacity: 2 } } offset_minutes_from_sunday_midnight: 0 } enabled: false You can see this policy is disabled, which is a problem. Production clusters should enable the default snapshot policy. When you show or enable the snapshot policy, you can see your tscli command reflected in the Configuration Events panel on this same page. Display the features used in a cluster configuration Log in to the ThoughtSpot cluster as the admin user. Use the tscli feature subcommand to display your current configuration. $ tscli feature get-all-config +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ | NAME | STATUS | CONFIGURATION | +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ | Firewall | Disabled | | | Saml | Disabled | | | Ldap | Disabled | | | CustomBranding | Disabled | | | CustomBrandingFontCustomization | Disabled | | | DataConnect | Disabled | | | RLS | Enabled | | | Callhome | Enabled | | | SSHTunnel | Enabled | | | Fileserver | Disabled | | +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ Relational Data Cache This section reports real-time information about tables in your cluster. Worksheet data is not included. Value Description TABLES LOADED Number of currently loaded tables. TABLES BEING UPDATED Number of table loads in-progress. NEW TABLES BEING LOADED Number of tables being loaded for the first time. ROWS Number of rows combined across all tables in ThoughtSpot. Relational Search Engine Value Description TABLES SEARCHABLE Tables that are indexed and can be searched. TABLES BEING INDEXED Total of in-progress table indexing. NEW TABLES BEING INDEXED Total of first-time, in-progress table indexing. TOKENS SEARCHABLE Number of tokens of all table (combined) indexed in ThoughtSpot. Critical Alerts Displays critical and warning alerts. This includes when an alert was generated and from which service and machine. Administrators can get a custom report by issuing a tscli alert list on the appliance: tscli alert list --since 4w The critical alerts you can encounter in this display are the following: TASK_FLAPPING Msg: Task {{.Service}}.{{.Task}} terminated {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when a task is crashing repeatedly. The service is evaluted across the whole cluster. So, if a service crashes 5 times in a day across all nodes in the cluster, this alert is generated. OREO_TERMINATED Msg: Oreo terminated on machine {{.Machine}} This alert is raised when the Oreo daemon on a machine terminates due to an error. This typically happens due to an error accessing Zookeeper, HDFS, or a hardware issue. HDFS_DISK_SPACE Msg: HDFS has less than {{.Perc}}% space free Raised when a HDFS cluster is low on total available disk space. ZK_INACCESSIBLE Msg: Zookeeper is not accessible Raised when Zookeeper is inaccessible. PERIODIC_BACKUP_FLAPPING Msg: Periodic backup failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when a periodic backup failed repeatedly. PERIODIC_SNAPSHOT_FLAPPING Msg: Periodic snapshot failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when periodic snapshot failed repeatedly. APPLICATION_INVALID_STATE_EXTERNAL Msg: {{.Service}}.{{.Task}} on {{.Machine}} at location {{.Location}} Raised when Application raises invalid state alert. The possible alert types are CRITICAL, WARNING, ERROR, and INFO. For a full reference, see the Alert code reference. Space Utilization The Space Utilization chart displays your cluster’s total capacity and estimated used capacity over time. The x-axis is by time and the y-axis measures the size in GB. You can zoom in and see daily or hourly utilization data. So, in the Space Utilization chart above, the green line shows the amount of capacity in use in the system, while the red line shows the total capacity. An increase in the red line at the end of a time period indicates the addition of extra hardware, resulting in increased capacity. The query for this Answer is the following: day of timestamp total capacity (gb) total used space (gb) daily last 90 days last 25 hours total capacity (gb) &gt; 0 total used space (gb) &gt; 0 The chart relies on the TS: Internal Table Wise Capacity WS worksheet. It tracks total used space, which consists of raw uncompressed data, including replication. Monthly Active Users This chart shows the number of active users in the system over the last four months, and during the current month. An active user is defined as a user who has logged in at least one time in the defined time interval, in this case months. The query for this Answer is the following: monthly last 4 months this month active users user != {null} This query relies on the TS: BI server worksheet. Monthly Ad-hoc Searches Number of ad-hoc searches (queries) issued per month. An ad-hoc query is defined as any search or change to a search that builds a new Answer (result). An ad-hoc search can also be generated through SpotIQ or another UI/API interaction. ThoughtSpot considers all of the following as ad-hoc searches (queries): User edits tokens (boxed terms) in the search bar. User opens an existing saved Answer and makes changes to tokens in the search bar. User opens an existing saved pinboard, edits a visualization, and makes change to the search tokens. Searches initiated by an API call for data with runtime filters It is not considered a search (query) in this context if a user opens an existing saved aggregated worksheet and makes changes to its underlying query. The query for this Answer is the following: ad-hoc search user action = &#39;answer_pinboard_context&#39; &#39;answer_saved&#39; &#39;answer_unsaved&#39; monthly last 4 months this month This Answer relies on data from the TS: BI Server worksheet. Monthly Pinboard Views Number of times a saved pinboard is viewed by a user. These scenarios are considered pinboard views: User opens an existing saved pinboard. User opens an embedded pinboard from a URL. Pinboard data is accessed using the an API. These scenarios are not considered pinboard views: A user opens SpotIQ tab pinboards. A user opens admin tab pinboards. The system loads a pinboard on the homepage. The system loads the ‘learn how to use ThoughtSpot’ pinboard. The query underlying this Answer is: pinboard views user action = &#39;pinboard_embed_view&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_no_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_view&#39; monthly last 4 months this month The query uses the TS: BI Server data source.

If you do not see it change or empty, you should check your cluster snapshot policy using the tscli command: $ tscli snapshot-policy show schedule { period { number: 1 unit: HOUR } retention_policy { bucket { time { number: 1 unit: HOUR } capacity: 3 } bucket { time { number: 4 unit: HOUR } capacity: 2 } } offset_minutes_from_sunday_midnight: 0 } enabled: false You can see this policy is disabled, which is a problem. Production clusters should enable the default snapshot policy. When you show or enable the snapshot policy, you can see your tscli command reflected in the Configuration Events panel on this same page. Display the features used in a cluster configuration Log in to the ThoughtSpot cluster as the admin user. Use the tscli feature subcommand to display your current configuration. $ tscli feature get-all-config +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ | NAME | STATUS | CONFIGURATION | +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ | Firewall | Disabled | | | Saml | Disabled | | | Ldap | Disabled | | | CustomBranding | Disabled | | | CustomBrandingFontCustomization | Disabled | | | DataConnect | Disabled | | | RLS | Enabled | | | Callhome | Enabled | | | SSHTunnel | Enabled | | | Fileserver | Disabled | | +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+ Relational Data Cache This section reports real-time information about tables in your cluster. Worksheet data is not included. Value Description TABLES LOADED Number of currently loaded tables. TABLES BEING UPDATED Number of table loads in-progress. NEW TABLES BEING LOADED Number of tables being loaded for the first time. ROWS Number of rows combined across all tables in ThoughtSpot. Relational Search Engine Value Description TABLES SEARCHABLE Tables that are indexed and can be searched. TABLES BEING INDEXED Total of in-progress table indexing. NEW TABLES BEING INDEXED Total of first-time, in-progress table indexing. TOKENS SEARCHABLE Number of tokens of all table (combined) indexed in ThoughtSpot. Critical Alerts Displays critical and warning alerts. This includes when an alert was generated and from which service and machine. Administrators can get a custom report by issuing a tscli alert list on the appliance: tscli alert list --since 4w The critical alerts you can encounter in this display are the following: TASK_FLAPPING Msg: Task {{.Service}}.{{.Task}} terminated {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when a task is crashing repeatedly. The service is evaluted across the whole cluster. So, if a service crashes 5 times in a day across all nodes in the cluster, this alert is generated. OREO_TERMINATED Msg: Oreo terminated on machine {{.Machine}} This alert is raised when the Oreo daemon on a machine terminates due to an error. This typically happens due to an error accessing Zookeeper, HDFS, or a hardware issue. HDFS_DISK_SPACE Msg: HDFS has less than {{.Perc}}% space free Raised when a HDFS cluster is low on total available disk space. ZK_INACCESSIBLE Msg: Zookeeper is not accessible Raised when Zookeeper is inaccessible. PERIODIC_BACKUP_FLAPPING Msg: Periodic backup failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when a periodic backup failed repeatedly. PERIODIC_SNAPSHOT_FLAPPING Msg: Periodic snapshot failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}} This alert is raised when periodic snapshot failed repeatedly. APPLICATION_INVALID_STATE_EXTERNAL Msg: {{.Service}}.{{.Task}} on {{.Machine}} at location {{.Location}} Raised when Application raises invalid state alert. The possible alert types are CRITICAL, WARNING, ERROR, and INFO. For a full reference, see the Alert code reference. Space Utilization The Space Utilization chart displays your cluster’s total capacity and estimated used capacity over time. The x-axis is by time and the y-axis measures the size in GB. You can zoom in and see daily or hourly utilization data. So, in the Space Utilization chart above, the green line shows the amount of capacity in use in the system, while the red line shows the total capacity. An increase in the red line at the end of a time period indicates the addition of extra hardware, resulting in increased capacity. The query for this Answer is the following: day of timestamp total capacity (gb) total used space (gb) daily last 90 days last 25 hours total capacity (gb) &gt; 0 total used space (gb) &gt; 0 The chart relies on the TS: Internal Table Wise Capacity WS worksheet. It tracks total used space, which consists of raw uncompressed data, including replication. Monthly Active Users This chart shows the number of active users in the system over the last four months, and during the current month. An active user is defined as a user who has logged in at least one time in the defined time interval, in this case months. The query for this Answer is the following: monthly last 4 months this month active users user != {null} This query relies on the TS: BI server worksheet. Monthly Ad-hoc Searches Number of ad-hoc searches (queries) issued per month. An ad-hoc query is defined as any search or change to a search that builds a new Answer (result). An ad-hoc search can also be generated through SpotIQ or another UI/API interaction. ThoughtSpot considers all of the following as ad-hoc searches (queries): User edits tokens (boxed terms) in the search bar. User opens an existing saved Answer and makes changes to tokens in the search bar. User opens an existing saved pinboard, edits a visualization, and makes change to the search tokens. Searches initiated by an API call for data with runtime filters It is not considered a search (query) in this context if a user opens an existing saved aggregated worksheet and makes changes to its underlying query. The query for this Answer is the following: ad-hoc search user action = &#39;answer_pinboard_context&#39; &#39;answer_saved&#39; &#39;answer_unsaved&#39; monthly last 4 months this month This Answer relies on data from the TS: BI Server worksheet. Monthly Pinboard Views Number of times a saved pinboard is viewed by a user. These scenarios are considered pinboard views: User opens an existing saved pinboard. User opens an embedded pinboard from a URL. Pinboard data is accessed using the an API. These scenarios are not considered pinboard views: A user opens SpotIQ tab pinboards. A user opens admin tab pinboards. The system loads a pinboard on the homepage. The system loads the ‘learn how to use ThoughtSpot’ pinboard. The query underlying this Answer is: pinboard views user action = &#39;pinboard_embed_view&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_no_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_view&#39; monthly last 4 months this month The query uses the TS: BI Server data source. Top Users Last Month This Answer shows the top ThoughtSpot users ranked by number of actions the users performed in the last 30 days. The possible user actions include: answer_unsaved User makes a change to tokens in the search bar. answer_saved User opens an existing saved answer and makes changes to tokens in the search bar. answer_pinboard_context User opens an existing saved pinboard, edits a context viz and makes a change to tokens in the search bar. answer_aggregated_worksheet User opens an existing saved aggregated worksheet and makes changes to tokens in the search bar. answer_upgrade Requests made for the sole purpose of upgrade. pinboard_view User opens an existing saved pinboard. pinboard_filter User adds, removes or applies values to a pinboard filter. pinboard_ad_hoc User drills down in a pinboard viz. data_chart_config Request for new data being generated following a chart config change. data_show_underlying_row Request to show underlying data for a data row(s). data_export Request to export data. pinboard_tspublic_runtime_filter Request to TSPublic/pinboarddata with runtime filters. answer_aggregated_worksheet_save User updates aggregated worksheet. answer_add_new_filter User adds a filter using the UI. data_show_underlying_viz Request to show underlying data for a data row(s). answer_view User opens an existing, saved answer. answer_viz_context_view User opens an existing saved pinboard, edits a context viz. pinboard_insight_view User opens SpotIQ tab pinboards. pinboard_admin_view User opens admin tab pinboards. pinboard_embed_view User opens embed pinboard from a URL. pinboard_homepage_view On loading of homepage pinboard. pinboard_learn_view On loading learn pinboard. pinboard_tspublic_no_runtime_filter Request to TSPublic/pinboard data without runtime filters. The query underlying this Answer is: top 10 ranked by user actions user action != &#39;invalid&#39; user != {null} user last 30 days today The query uses the TS: BI Server data source. Top Pinboards Last Month This Answer shows the top ThoughtSpot Pinboards ranked by number of views in the last 30 days. The query underlying this Answer is: top 10 ranked by pinboard views user action = &#39;pinboard_embed_view&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_no_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_tspublic_runtime_filter&#39; &#39;pinboard_view&#39; pinboard != {null} pinboard last 30 days today The query uses the TS: BI Server data source. Ad-hoc search by user This Answer shows the top ten ThoughtSpot users ranked by the number of ad-hoc searches they have completed. The query underlying this Answer is: top 10 ad-hoc search user action = &#39;answer_pinboard_context&#39; &#39;answer_saved&#39; &#39;answer_unsaved by user sort by ad-hoc search The query uses the TS: BI Server data source. Today’s users This Answer shows all users who logged in to ThoughtSpot today. The query underlying this Answer is: latest time by user user !={null} today The query uses the TS: BI Server data source. Configuration Events This system answer displays recent events that changed the configuration of the system. This panel displays configuration events related to: Cluster Configuration Reports configuration actions from the tscli and tql commands. Metadata Management Events related to metadata such as column names, column visibility, column and data definition, column rank and so forth. User Management Events related to creating, updating, or adding new users and groups. For a more detailed list, including the user that issued a command, you can use the tscli event list command. Administrators can ssh into the cluster and specify a time period or even a type of command to include.

  <p>You can view system and usage information for your ThoughtSpot cluster from the <strong>TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard</strong>. This Pinboard contains several charts and tables that track monthly active users, top Pinboards by number of views, today’s users, and so on. To view this Pinboard, search for it in the <strong>Pinboards</strong> tab.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-ts-stats-system-information-and-usage-pinboard">Understand the TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard</h2>

<p>The <strong>TS Stats: System Information and Usage Pinboard</strong> page consists of standard ThoughtSpot Answers that update in real time and rely on internal system data. The Answers rely on underlying system worksheets, which are available to ThoughtSpot administrators. The information in these worksheets updates hourly from internal tables that collect monitoring statistics.</p>

<p>The <strong>more options menu</strong> <img src="/6.3/images/icon-more-10px.png" alt="" class="inline" /> for the Answers in this Pinboard contains fewer options than the traditional menu. You can <strong>SpotIQ analyst</strong>, <strong>download</strong>, <strong>edit,</strong> or <strong>present</strong> the Answer. When you <strong>edit</strong> the Answer, you see the query that ThoughtSpot built the Answer on. You can also copy the Answer’s embed link, use <a href="/6.3/end-user/pinboards/answer-explorer.html">Answer Explorer</a> on the Answer, or interact with the Answer by <a href="/6.3/complex-search/drill-down.html">drilling down</a>. While you can interact with and change a copied version of the Answer, you cannot save changes to the underlying query.</p>

<h2 id="cluster-summary">Cluster Summary</h2>

<p>This system panel contains basic information about your cluster.  The <strong>NUMBER OF
NODES</strong> is the number of installed nodes. This doesn’t reflect the active nodes
which may be more or less.</p>

<p>This summary includes the <strong>LAST SNAPSHOT TIME</strong> it reflects whether regular
snapshots of your cluster are collected. This value should update regularly in
real time. If you do not see it change or empty, you should check your cluster
snapshot policy using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tscli</code> command:</p>

<h2 id="critical-alerts">Critical Alerts</h2>

<p>Displays critical and warning alerts. This includes when an alert was generated
and from which service and machine. Administrators can get a custom report by
issuing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tscli alert list</code> on the appliance:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tscli alert list --since 4w
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The critical alerts you can encounter in this display are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TASK_FLAPPING</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task {{.Service}}.{{.Task}} terminated {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}}</code></p>

    <p>This alert is raised when a task is crashing repeatedly. The service is evaluted across the whole cluster. So, if a service crashes 5 times in a day across all nodes in the cluster, this alert is generated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OREO_TERMINATED</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Oreo terminated on machine {{.Machine}}</code></p>

    <p>This alert is raised when the Oreo daemon on a machine terminates due to an error. This typically happens due to an error accessing Zookeeper, HDFS, or a hardware issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HDFS_DISK_SPACE</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HDFS has less than {{.Perc}}% space free</code></p>

    <p>Raised when a HDFS cluster is low on total available disk space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZK_INACCESSIBLE</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zookeeper is not accessible</code></p>

    <p>Raised when Zookeeper is inaccessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PERIODIC_BACKUP_FLAPPING</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Periodic backup failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}}</code></p>

    <p>This alert is raised when a periodic backup failed repeatedly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PERIODIC_SNAPSHOT_FLAPPING</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Periodic snapshot failed {{._actual_num_occurrences}} times in last {{._earliest_duration_str}}</code></p>

    <p>This alert is raised when periodic snapshot failed repeatedly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APPLICATION_INVALID_STATE_EXTERNAL</code></p>

    <p><strong>Msg</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{.Service}}.{{.Task}} on {{.Machine}} at location {{.Location}}</code></p>

    <p>Raised when Application raises invalid state alert.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The possible alert types are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRITICAL</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WARNING</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ERROR</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code>. For a

<h2 id="space-utilization">Space Utilization</h2>

<p>The <strong>Space Utilization</strong> chart displays your cluster’s total capacity and estimated used capacity over time.</p>

<p><img src="/6.3/images/admin-portal-overview-pinboard-space-utilization.png" alt="Space utilization" title="Space Utilization" /></p>

<p>The x-axis is by time and the y-axis measures the size in GB. You can zoom in
and see daily or hourly utilization data. So, in the <strong>Space Utilization</strong> chart
above, the green line shows the amount of capacity in use in the system, while
the red line shows the total capacity. An increase in the red line at the end of
a time period indicates the addition of extra hardware, resulting in increased
capacity.</p>

<p>The query for this Answer is the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>day of timestamp
total capacity (gb)
total used space (gb)
daily
last 90 days last 25 hours
total capacity (gb) &gt; 0
total used space (gb) &gt; 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The chart relies on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TS: Internal Table Wise Capacity WS</code> worksheet. It
tracks  total used space, which consists of raw uncompressed data, including
replication.</p>

<h2 id="mau">Monthly Active Users</h2>

<p>This chart shows the number of active users in the system over the last four months, and during the current month. An active user is defined as a user who has logged in at least one time in the defined time interval, in this case months.</p>

<p>The query for this Answer is the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>monthly
last 4 months this month
active users
user != {null}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This query relies on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TS: BI server</code> worksheet.</p>

<h2 id="monthly-searches">Monthly Ad-hoc Searches</h2>

<p>Number of ad-hoc searches (queries) issued per month. An ad-hoc query is defined as any search or change to a search that builds a new Answer (result). An ad-hoc search can also be generated through SpotIQ or another UI/API interaction.</p>

<p>ThoughtSpot considers all of the following as ad-hoc searches (queries):</p>

<ul>
  <li>User edits tokens (boxed terms) in the search bar.</li>
  <li>User opens an existing saved Answer and makes changes to tokens in the search bar.</li>
  <li>User opens an existing saved pinboard, edits a visualization, and makes change to the search tokens.</li>
  <li>Searches initiated by an API call for data with runtime filters</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not considered a search (query) in this context if a user opens an existing saved
aggregated worksheet and makes changes to its underlying
query.</p>

<p>The query for this Answer is the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ad-hoc search
user action = 'answer_pinboard_context' 'answer_saved' 'answer_unsaved'
monthly
last 4 months this month
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This Answer relies on data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TS: BI Server</code> worksheet.</p>

<h2 id="monthly-pb-views">Monthly Pinboard Views</h2>

<p>Number of times a saved pinboard is viewed by a user. These scenarios are
considered pinboard views:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User opens an existing saved pinboard.</li>
  <li>User opens an embedded pinboard from a URL.</li>
  <li>Pinboard data is accessed using the an API.</li>
</ul>

<p>These scenarios are not considered pinboard views:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user opens SpotIQ tab pinboards.</li>
  <li>A user opens admin tab pinboards.</li>
  <li>The system loads a pinboard on the homepage.</li>
  <li>The system loads the ‘learn how to use ThoughtSpot’ pinboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>The query underlying this Answer is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pinboard views
user action = 'pinboard_embed_view' 'pinboard_tspublic_no_runtime_filter' 'pinboard_tspublic_runtime_filter' 'pinboard_view'
monthly
last 4 months this month
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The query uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TS: BI Server</code> data source.</p>
