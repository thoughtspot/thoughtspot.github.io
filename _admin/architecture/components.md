ThoughtSpot consists of a cluster of one or more nodes, acting together to
provide analytic answers to business questions. As such, there are only a few
integration points with ThoughtSpot on your network. The major components in a ThoughtSpot cluster are:

ThoughtSpot can handle a wide variety of different data sources. ThoughtSpot
does all analysis against data in memory to help achieve fast results across
millions and billions of records of data. ThoughtSpot caches the data in order
to process it.

The ThoughtSpot appliance can be a physical appliance that ThoughtSpot ships,
one or more AWS instances that are clustered together, or one or more VMware
instances that are clustered together. From an external interface, regardless of
the appliance type, the appliance appears to be a single instance.

For authentication (logging in), some source of user information is required.
These define the login requirements and access control groups. Users must access
the data from a supported browser to view saved content, or perform
searched-based analytics. Finally, it is recommended that you have some sort of
networked attached storage for storing backups in case of hardware failure.
