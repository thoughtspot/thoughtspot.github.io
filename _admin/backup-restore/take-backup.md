ThoughtSpot enables you to manually create a backup to restore a cluster to a prior state or a differently configured appliance. You can also move the backup from an appliance to a virtual cluster or vice versa. To restore a cluster from a backup, [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#).

You create a manual backup from an existing snapshot. So, you must identify an existing snapshot to use or take a new snapshot first. The time required to take a backup depends on the data size. Taking a backup does not take long, and happens in the background while the cluster is running.

Beginning with release 6.1, you can back up to an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Using tscli
To manually create a backup using ThoughtSpot's command line interface, tscli:
1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
    ```
    $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
    ```
2. [Create a manual snapshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/overview-snapshot.html#snapshot-tscli) or find a snapshot you want to use.
   To find a snapshot you want to use for your backup, run `tscli snapshot ls`:

    ```
    $ tscli snapshot ls

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Name          : pre330
    Reason        : pre3.3.0
    Hdfs snapshot : pre330
    Start         : Wed May 4 18:07:32 2016
    End           : Wed May 4 18:08:23 2016
    Size(Full)    : 13.24 GB
    Size(LW)      : 4.96 GB
    Size(Dataless): 39.76 MB
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ...
    ```

3. Make sure you have enough room on the target disk.

    In addition to the size of the snapshot, you must have 10 to 12 GB of disk space. This is because the process requires space for temporary files. You can use the `df -h` command to check disk size.

    ```
    $ df -h
    ```

4. Create the backup, designating the [type of backup]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/backup-modes.html#), the snapshot name, and a directory:

    Choose the [mode of backup]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/backup-modes.html#) you want to create, either `full`, `lightweight`, or `dataless`. You specify an existing directory path, but the folder (the last part of the path: `/home/admin/<folder>`) **must not** already exist. ThoughtSpot creates the folder when it runs a backup. The BASE value is the name of the backup.

    ```
    $ tscli backup create [-h]
        [--mode {full|light|dataless}]
        [--type {full}]
        [--base snapshot_name>]
        [--storage_type {local|nas|cloud}][--remote]
        [--bucket_name]
         <name> <directory>
    ```

    Here is a sample `tscli backup create` command:
    ```
    $ tscli backup create --mode dataless <my_snapshot> <directory_path>
    ```
