Entity categories specify how to categorize the data in the column, by entity type. By default, `ENTITY TYPE` is not set. Entity categories support [SearchIQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-searchiq.html#) so that when you type a natural question, ThoughtSpot better knows how to interpret it. For example, if you ask "who are the top performers?" ThoughtSpot will first choose columns set with `PERSON` from which to return answers. If you ask "when was the movie Jurassic Park released?", columns set to `TIME` will be used to answer the "when" part of the question, and so forth.

If you have access to tables and worksheets for data modeling purposes, you can specify entity categories for their columns. This lets you designate that column as representing a person, place, or thing. So then when a user asks "Which", "Who", or "Where", an appropriate response can more easily be found in the data.

If you're not sure how to change the data modeling settings, see the
[Overview of data modeling settings]({{ site.baseurl}}/admin/data-modeling/data-modeling-settings.html).
