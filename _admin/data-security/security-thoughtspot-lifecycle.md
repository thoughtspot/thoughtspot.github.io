## Overview

A ThoughtSpot deployment consists of the following high level software systems:

* Operating System (OS) and software packages installed on the OS
* Third-party software
* ThoughtSpot application services (binaries and configuration)

### Operating System
All ThoughtSpot physical appliances, virtual machines (VMs) and public cloud
images come pre-installed with CentOS 7. The [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
distribution of Linux is owned by [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en) and
closely tracks versions of RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

ThoughtSpot uses the minimal install of CentOS 7 with the addition of a few
software packages (e.g. Python) needed for ThoughtSpot operations.  The most
notable change to the installation is to the Linux kernel, which is sourced from
the current long term stable kernel version instead of the default included in
CentOS 7 (kernel-lt package).  To list all the installed packages, see
[Checking Package Versions](#checking-os-package-versions).

### Third-Party Software (Middleware)

Third party software used includes Java, Boost C++ libraries, Google protocol
buffers, etc.  These are software components necessary for operation of the
ThoughtSpot application.  ThoughtSpot only uses software licensed for
distribution.

## Development and Release Process

ThoughtSpot releases its software as a tarball containing all the ThoughtSpot
application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and an operating
system image.  Installation or update using this release tarball on appliances,
VMs, or cloud instances updates each of these components.

### Operating System

Building the operating system image including software packages is a multi-step process:

1.  Begin with the set of packages in the base OS image and our added packages.

2.  Configure all installation to only use official public RedHat repositories.

3.  For each package, install the current stable version including any security patches.

4.  Bring up the image on all supported platforms for stability and performance
    testing along with the ThoughtSpot application stack.  Success criteria: no OS
    impact on stability or performance.

5.  Scan the Operating System and ThoughtSpot application stack using Qualys scans
    with additional modules enabled: Vulnerability Management, Web App Scanning.

6.  Review all vulnerabilities found.  Success criteria is zero severity 4+ vulnerabilities.

7.  Assuming all above testing and exit criteria are met, the OS image is considered qualified.

### Third-Party Software

Third-party software is periodically sourced from the upstream distribution of
each software component.  Unlike OS and ThoughtSpot application, this changes
less frequently and on an as needed basis, when any new security vulnerability
or stability issue is discovered in the library.  The list of all third-party
software as well as licensing details are here.

### ThoughtSpot Application

ThoughtSpot follows industry standard best practices for writing robust
software.  Every code change is reviewed by at least one engineer.  Our
engineering team consists of senior engineers from Enterprise software and web
companies.

ThoughtSpot uses a small number of proven programming languages powering some of
the largest enterprises in the world.  ThoughtSpot tracks stability,
performance, and reliability of our software and services aggressively.  The
ThoughtSpot platform is trusted by dozens of global F2000 organizations.

#### Protection of Source Code
Source code is private and not shared publicly, e.g. all distribution to
customers is in binary or minified format to discourage reverse engineering.

#### Automated Tools
We use automated tools and infrastructure like Jenkins, Kubernetes, AWS,
partnering with the teams behind these systems so as to adopt best practices.
For example, all our automation runs through Jenkins, which is managed by
CloudBees (the company behind Jenkins) using an enterprise license with regular
security patching, and so on.  We upgrade our automation tools regularly.

#### Independent Testing

Independent testing is done outside of the product team by pre sales and post
sales before promoting to production.  Some areas are tested by third party
testers.

### Security Hardening

Starting 4.5.1.5, we have also taken specific steps to incorporate most of CIS
standard recommendations towards hardening.

## Installation and Upgrade Process

ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball which contains the
ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and
Operating System image.

### Operating System Image Installation

Installing ThoughtSpot on any node (VM, cloud instance, appliance) automatically
updates the operating system and required packages on the node.  No Internet or
repository access is required for this, the update is applied directly from the
release tarball.

Specifically, all nodes running ThoughtSpot are required to have two root
partitions on their boot drive of which one of them is booted from at any given
time.  During installation or update, the Operating System image contained in
the release tarball is copied into the second currently-unused root partition
and the system switches to it through a reboot.

### Checking OS Package Versions

The following command run from any ThoughtSpot node will indicate versions of
all installed packages:
```
rpm -qa
```
### Upgrades

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades.  The exact
same process used during installation is also applied during upgrades.  The
previous OS image on a node gets replaced by the new image carried in the
release tarball.

Only some releases may patch the Operating System, not all.  Typically, all
major and minor releases (e.g. 4.4, 4.5, 4.5.1, 5.0) upgrade OS patches, whereas
only some patch releases (e.g. 4.4.1.4) contain OS patches.

### Distributed Clusters and Failure Handling

On distributed clusters, individual nodes receive the OS image from the release
tarball individually.  Initially, the new image is deployed on a single node
only.  When that node is deemed healthy following the update and a rich set of
tests, the image is made available to remaining nodes in the cluster.

If a node fails to patch, then ThoughtSpot support will modify the upgrade
workflow to either retry the patching or skip and exclude the node.

### Third-Party Software

Installation or upgrade of ThoughtSpot deployments automatically upgrades all
third-party software to the version included in the release tarball.

## Security Scanning and Patching Process

The ThoughtSpot Security team continuously scans security bulletins for new
vulnerabilities discovered in included OS packages (e.g., Linux Kernel, libc) and
third party software (e.g., Java).  Additionally, weekly scans are done for all
release branches using Qualys with the following additional modules enabled:
Vulnerability Management, Web App Scanning.  The security scans discover
vulnerabilities at all layers: OS, third-party software, as well as ThoughtSpot
application binaries and configuration.  Additionally, ThoughtSpot periodically
scans all source code for third-party software as well as ThoughtSpot’s
proprietary code base for vulnerabilities or unsafe usage using SourceClear.

After a critical new vulnerability is found (severity 4 or 5), ThoughtSpot
includes the corresponding patch in the next patch release for all supported
release branches.  Consult ThoughtSpot documentation or support to find out if
you are on an active or supported release branch.

After a new patch release with a critical security vulnerability is available,
customers are encouraged to upgrade their deployment quickly.

### Latency

We recommend customers to wait for the next regular release for receiving
security patches.  However, should a critical vulnerability be discovered in the
interim, ThoughtSpot can push out a new patch release containing the required
patches, if available upstream.

ThoughtSpot targets a three week or less cadence for generating patch releases for
all supported release branches.  Timeline for the new release and patching
depends on availability of the patch upstream (e.g., not all vulnerabilities in
Linux are immediately fixed) and qualification (ThoughtSpot qualifies each build
on each supported cloud and on-prem platform).  If a fix is unavailable upstream
at the moment, customers and ThoughtSpot support can work together to identify
potential workarounds.
