This guide provides information for application administrators.

Before addressing the major components of this guide, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the general top-level [architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/architecture/components.html) of the ThoughtSpot service.

Administrators are responsible for many facets of the ThoughtSpot service. They are most frequently in charge of these common processes:

- [Installation and setup of ThoughtSpot]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/intro.html)
- [Loading and managing data]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/loading/loading-intro.html)
- [Managing users and groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html)
- [Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-security/about-security.html)
- [System administration]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/system-admin/sysadmin-overview.html)
- [Backup and Restore]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/choose-strategy.html)

Additionally, administrators are often involved in the following workflows:
- [Data modeling]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/about-data-modeling-intro.html)
- [Using worksheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.html) to simplify search
- [Using views]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/about-query-on-query.html) for 'stacked' search;
   note that starting with Release 5.2, you can accomplish some aspects of search stacking by using the `IN` keyword (See https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/complex-search/in-keyword-searches.html).
- [Managing scheduled jobs]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/manage-jobs/about-scheduled-pinboards.html)
- [Monitoring system health]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/system-monitor/introduction.html)
- [Troubleshooting]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-intro.html)
