Materialized views can get out of sync with their underlying data. If the status of a view is **Stale**, you must refresh the view manually to sync it with the table.

Note that until it is refreshed, the view remains searchable.

To refresh a view manually, follow these steps:

1. To find your view, click **Data** in the top menu, and choose **Views**.

3. Click **Joins**.

4. In the **Materialization** panel, notice that the **Status** is _Stale_.

5. Next to the _Stale_ status, click **Refresh Data**.
