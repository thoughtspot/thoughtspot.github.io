Use ThoughtSpot Loader (`tsload`) to load data from a CSV text file into an existing table in ThoughtSpot. ThoughtSpot Loader (`tsload`) is a common way to import data. When using `tsload`, you can load larger datasets and make the loading process repeatable through scripting.

The `tsload` command accepts flags that enable you to specify column and row separators, date or timestamp formats, null value representations, and similar parameters. Many of these options have defaults that you can override.

Before importing data, you need to [build the schema](create-schema.html#).

After importing data, you can see it in the **Data** tab.

## ThoughtSpot Loader

To use ThoughtSpot Loader, type the command `tsload` followed by the appropriate flags. You can see the list of the flags it accepts in the [ThoughtSpot Loader flag reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/data-importer-ref.html#), or by issuing `tsload -help` on the command line.

The `tsload` feature supports both full and incremental data loads. For incremental loads, it performs an upsert (insert or update). If an incoming row has the same primary key as an existing row, it updates the existing row with new values.

You can integrate `tsload` into your ETL environment for more automated data loads. Most ETL tools enable you to write target data into files, and support scripted post-transformation actions that include loading data into ThoughtSpot.

### Load data using tsload
To manually load data into ThoughtSpot, follow these steps.

You can also save the `tsload` commands to a script, for reuse.

1.  Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
    ```
    $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
    ```
2.  Change to the directory that contains the staged CSV files.
    ```
    $ cd <directory>
    ```
3.  Use the following syntax to invoke `tsload`, specifying the appropriate flags, and your data source file:

    ```
    $ tsload --target_database=<my_database>
           --target_table=<my_table> --alsologtostderr
           --empty_target --source_file=<my_file.csv> --v 1
           --field_separator="separator_char"
    ```

    This example imports the CSV file `ssbm_customer.csv` into the table CUSTOMER:

    ```
    $ tsload --target_database=SAMPLE_DB
           --target_table=CUSTOMER --alsologtostderr
           --empty_target --source_file=ssbm_customer.csv
           --v 1 --field_separator "|"
    ```
4. Once `tsload` starts processing the data, you can see messages that indicate the progress. When the load is complete, you can see two summary messages: `source summary` and `load summary`.

    ```
    Started processing data row
    Source has 32 data rows, ignored row count 0
    Waiting for rows to commit...(please wait)

    Source summary
    --------------
    Data source:                     ssbm_customer.csv
    Source data format:              csv
    Header row?:                     no
    Tokenizer Options:               escape_char: "" field_separator: "|" enclosing_char: "\""
    Date format:                     %Y%m%d
    Date time format:                %Y%m%d %H:%M:%S
    Flexible mode?:                  no

    Load summary
    ------------
    Target table:                    CUSTOMER
    Should empty target?:            yes
    Status:                          Successful
    Rows total:                      32
    Rows successfully loaded:        30
    Rows failed to load:             0
    Rows duplicate/omitted:          2
    % of Rows successfully loaded:   93.75 %
    Load Rate (MB/s):                0.00 MB/s
    Load Rate (Rows/s):              3.53 Rows/s
    Start time (Wallclock):          Tue Jan 29 09:09:07
    End time (Wallclock):            Tue Jan 29 09:09:08
    Total load time = 1.13 seconds = 0.02 minutes = 0.00 hours
    Data size = 50 bytes = 0.06 KB = 0.00 MB
    ```
5. In the load summary, check the **Rows duplicate/omitted** number.

    This indicates the number of rows (if any) that `tsload` did not load because they did not satisfy the table constraints. A common cause of this would be a duplicate primary key. If `tsload` omitted any rows, review your CSV file, make the required adjustments, and then load it again.

    In the example above, `tsload` omitted two rows. This data needs to be cleaned and reloaded.

6. After correctly loading your file, repeat this process to load data from any additional CSV files.

## Loading data from an AWS S3 bucket

If you have data in `.csv` format stored in an AWS bucket, you can load it directly to ThoughtSpot.

### Assigning S3 read-only role to your EC2 instance
If your cluster is on version 5.3.1 or later, you can assign an S3 read-only role to your ThoughtSpot EC2 instance(s) so the instance(s) can access the S3 bucket from which you want to load the data. This eliminates the need to enter the AWS S3 credentials when loading your data. For details, see: [Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html){:target="_blank"} in Amazon's AWS documentation.

If you are using S3 for persistent storage, and assigned the *ec2rolewithfulls3access* IAM role to your instance, you do ***not*** need to complete this step in order to load data with S3.

If you already configured the IAM role, you do not need to supply the `--s3a_access_key`, `--s3a_secret_key` and `--s3a_region` parameters when loading data with `tsload`.

To load data from an AWS S3 bucket, do the following:

1.  Log in to the Linux shell of your AWS instance using SSH.

2.  Use the following syntax to invoke `tsload`, specifying the appropriate flags and your data source file. If you do not supply the `--s3a_bucket_name`, `tsload` prompts you to enter it.

    ```
    $ tsload --source_file "/s3a/default/<my_file_in_aws>"
           --target_database "<my_database_in_ThoughtSpot>" --target_table "<my_table_in_the_database_in_ThoughtSpot>" --s3a_bucket_name <bucket_name>
    ```   
    {% include important.html content="--source_file should contain the file path inside the bucket and <strong><em>must</em></strong> be prefixed by <code>/s3a/default</code>. For example, to load from a file named “directory/file.csv”, the --source_file should be “/s3a/default/directory/file.csv”." %}

    This example imports the CSV file `teams.csv` into the table `teams` in the database `temp`:

    ```
    $ tsload --source_file "/aws/default/teams.csv"
           --target_database "temp" --target_table "teams"
    ```    

3. After running the `tsload` command, you are prompted to enter additional AWS S3 information:

    * AWS S3a bucket name

    If you have no IAM role configured, you must enter the following information as well:

    * AWS S3a region

    * AWS S3a access key

    * AWS S3a secret key

    Optionally, these four pieces of information can be inserted at the beginning of the command (in step 2), using the following flags: <br>
    * `--s3a_bucket_name "<Name of bucket that contains the source CSV file>"`<br>
    * `--s3a_region "<Region where the bucket is located>"`<br>
    * `--s3a_access_key "<AWS S3 access key>"`<br>
    * `--s3a_secret_key "<AWS S3 secret key>"`<br>

4.  After the processing begins, progress messages appear, and then source and load summary messages after the load is complete.

## Loading data from a GCP GCS bucket

If you have data in `.csv` format stored in a GCS bucket, you can load it directly to ThoughtSpot.

### Assigning GCS read-only role to your GCP instance
You can assign a read-only role to your ThoughtSpot GCP instance(s) so the instance(s) can access the GCS bucket from which you want to load the data. This eliminates the need to enter the GCP GCS credentials when loading your data. For details, refer to the storage setting detailed in the GCP [Create an instance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/gcp/launch-an-instance.html#create-an-instance) section.

If you are using GCS for persistent storage, you already assigned the **Set access for each API** scope to your instance and specified **Full** storage access, so you do ***not*** need to complete this step in order to load data with GCS.

### Create the database and table

1. Log in to the Linux shell of your GCP instance using SSH.
2. Invoke TQL:

    ```
    $ tql

    TQL>
    ```
3. Create the database:

    ```
    TQL> CREATE DATABASE temp;
    ```    
4. Connect to the database:

    ```
    TQL> USE temp;
    ```
5. Create the table

    ```
    TQL> create table teams (id int, name VARCHAR(255));
    TQL> exit;
    ```

### Load data

Use the following syntax to invoke `tsload`, specifying the appropriate flags and your data source file:

```
$ tsload --source_file /gs/default/team.csv
       --target_database temp
       --target_table teams
       --bucket_name "my_gcs_bucket"
       --has_header_row 2>/dev/null

$ Header row read successfully
Source has 2 data rows, has header row, ignored row count 0
Waiting for rows to commit...(please wait)

Total load time = 1.78 seconds = 0.03 minutes = 0.00 hours
Data size = 19 bytes = 0.02 KB = 0.00 MB
```

### Verify the table contents

1. Invoke TQL:

    ```
    $ tql

    TQL>
    ```
2. Connect to the database:

    ```
    TQL> USE temp;
    ```        
3. Show the table data:

   ```
   TQL> select * from teams;
   ```

   Table contents are displayed:

   ```
   id|name
   -------
   1|sameer
   2|sandeep
   ```
