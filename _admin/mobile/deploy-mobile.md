Deploying the ThoughtSpot mobile app to your users allows them to access their data and make decisions remotely from their Apple iOS device. For more information about features in the mobile app, refer to [ThoughtSpot mobile overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/mobile/use-mobile.html#).

## Deployment options

There are two options for your users to download the ThoughtSpot mobile app:
- App Store for iOS
- Your MDM platform

### App Store for iOS
The ThoughtSpot app is available from the App Store for iOS. Your users can download it directly from there.

### Mobile device management platform
There are two ways to provide the ThoughtSpot app to your users with your MDM platform:

#### Option 1 [Recommended]: Provide a link to the app in the App Store for iOS.

Almost all of the platforms allow you to link to the app in the App Store. With this option, your users download it directly and automatically receive the latest updates, when they are available.

To add a link to the ThoughtSpot app on your management platform, refer to the following platform-specific information:
