Many organizations don't use SAML for user authentication. In other scenarios, some users are created only in ThoughtSpot. In such cases, you can choose to authenticate users against ThoughtSpot internal authentication.

{% include note.html content="Before the user logs into ThoughtSpot, the user must exist in ThoughtSpot. This is independent of the authentication mechanism." %}

If you have been using ThoughtSpot with users you created manually, and you now want to transition to SAML, contact [ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html). They can assist you in migrating existing users to their SAML equivalents.
