Working with ThoughtSpot, you can configure your installation to work with Slack.
Users can use the integration, called **Spot**, to make queries or view charts.
Any users with administrative rights can apply a `spot` sticker to specific
objects. Then, the object is available through Slack.

The first time a user messages Spot, it returns a link to log into ThoughtSpot.
Once a user logs in, the user's Slack and ThoughtSpot account are associated.
Actions a user makes from Slack are tied to the user's permissions and
authorization.

## Spot workflow for administration   

Here are the high level steps:

3. Label answers, pinboards, and other objects with the spot sticker.
4. Start Spot Bot.
5. Register Spot bot with your company's Slack instance.
6. Register your Spot Slack account to ThoughtSpot.
