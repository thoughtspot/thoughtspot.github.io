ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball that contains the ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and Operating System image. Third party softwares are licensed software components necessary for operation of the ThoughtSpot application. These include Java, Boost C++ libraries, Google protocol buffers, and so on.

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades. Installation and upgrade use the same process, replacing the older OS image on a node by the new image delivered in the release tarball.

ThoughtSpot Support will contact you to schedule an update when a minor or major upgrade becomes available.

You can also view available releases from the Admin Console. To view new releases, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the **Admin** tab from the top navigation bar. Select **Upgrade** from the side navigation bar that appears.

The **Upgrade** page shows your cluster's current version, and any new releases that are available. If no releases are available, you see the following screen.
