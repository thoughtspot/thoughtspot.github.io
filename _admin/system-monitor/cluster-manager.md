The **Cluster Manager** section show detailed information about a cluster
including latency over time, snapshot status, installed release, node functions,
and logs.

 ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/control_center_cluster_mgmt.png "Partial view of the **System Health** center: Cluster Manager")

Only the **Average Latency Last 2 Weeks (sec)** panel contains a standard
ThoughtSpot visualization. The other visualizations rely on internal queries
that are not accessible. You can, however, **Present** or **Copy link** on them.

## Cluster Details

The fields on this visualization has the following meaning:

 <table>
 <colgroup>
    <col style="width:35%" />

    </tr>
    <tr>
       <th>Cluster Name</th>
       <td>
          The name of the cluster defined at installation time.
       </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <th>Cluster ID</th>
       <td>
          The ID of the cluster set at installation time.
       </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <th>Last Update Time</th>
       <td>
          Last time the cluster was updated.

      <td>
        Identifies the full release number.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

You can also use the `tscli logs` command to review log data from your cluster.

## List of Snapshots

This visualization shows the snapshots _and the backups_ taken on the cluster.
The fields on this visualization has the following meaning:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col style="width:35%" />
   <col style="width:65%" />
</colgroup>
   <tr>
      <th>Field</th>

      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td>
         Name of the snapshot file. These files are stored in the `/usr/local/scaligent/backup` directory on your cluster.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Reason</th>
      <td>
        Identifies the reason the snapshot/backup was created. You should see several period snapshots if your cluster is configured properly. You may also see evidence here of manual backups. For example, you should be sure your cluster is backed up before major events such as upgrades. Email <a href="mailto:support@thoughtspot.com">support@thoughtspot.com</a> if you don't see evidence your cluster is periodically creating snapshots.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Size</th>
      <td>
        Size of the backup in gigabytes.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

## Average Latency Last 2 Weeks (sec)

This visualization relies on the `TS: BI Server` worksheet to display the
average database latency over the last 15 days. Database latency how long it
takes for a user to query data from ThoughtSpot. You can use the visualization
menu to drill down to its underlying query:

```
average datacache (sec)
average total (sec)
daily
last 15 days
for database latency (us) > 0
```
