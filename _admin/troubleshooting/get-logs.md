For troubleshooting on specific incidents or cluster problems, two things are important: understanding your current configuration and getting a log bundle.

## Check your configuration

1. Log in to the ThoughtSpot cluster as the `admin` user.
2. Use the `tscli feature` subcommand to display your current configuration.

    ```
    $ tscli feature get-all-config
    +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+
    |              NAME               |  STATUS  | CONFIGURATION |
    +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+
    | Firewall                        | Disabled |               |
    | Saml                            | Disabled |               |
    | CustomBranding                  | Disabled |               |
    | CustomBrandingFontCustomization | Disabled |               |
    | DataConnect                     | Disabled |               |
    | RLS                             | Enabled  |               |
    | Callhome                        | Enabled  |               |
    | SSHTunnel                       | Enabled  |               |
    | Fileserver                      | Disabled |               |
    +---------------------------------+----------+---------------+
    ```

## How to get logs

There are two ways to get logs:

-   When ThoughtSpot encounters a problem, a red bar displays in the browser with an error message. You can click **What Happened?** in the error message for more details. To download related logs, click **Download Trace**. Send the logs as an email attachment to the support contact that is provided. Clicking **Report Problem** will also send the logs as an email attachment to your administrator.

- You can generate a log bundle using the `tscli` command `tscli logs collect` if
you are comfortable with Linux. The command lets you specify which logs to
collect and from what time periods.

    Usage for this command is:

    ```
    tscli logs collect
      --include <selector | glob>
      [--exclude <selector | glob>]
      [--since <hours,minutes,days>
      | --from <yyyymmdd-HH:MM>
      --to <yyyymmdd-HH:MM>]
      [--out <path>]
      [--maxsize <size_in_MB_or_GB>]
      [--sizeonly]
    ```

    The full list of all selectors is:

    -   `all` collects all of the logs listed from the system and the ThoughtSpot application.
    -   `system` collects all system logs, e.g. syslog, upstart, mail logs, etc.
    -   `ts` collects all logs from the ThoughtSpot application. This includes falcon, sage, orion core (cluster management), etc.
    -   `orion` collects all orion logs including cluster management, hdfs, zookeeper, etc.
    Detailed syntax and options are listed in the [tscli command reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/tscli-command-ref.html#).


## Examples

Here are some examples of usage for the command `tscli logs collect`:

To collect all logs from the past day to the default location (`/tmp/logs.tar.gz`):

```
$ tscli logs collect --include all --since 1d
```

In this example, `all` is a selector for all the available logs.

In most cases, you can probably use the selector `ts` to only capture logs for the ThoughtSpot application:

```
$ tscli logs collect --include ts --since 2d
```

For debugging cluster management issues, use a command like this one, which collects logs for system and orion from the past 2 hours. The output is written to /tmp/debug.tar.gz as specified using `--out`:

```
$ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --since 2h --out /tmp/debug.tar.gz
```

This command collects logs from a specific time window:

```
$ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --from 20150520-12:00 --to 20150522-12:30
```

Advanced usage alert! You can also use `--include` and `--exclude` to specify filesystem paths as a glob pattern. This works like the Linux find(1) command. Pass all the entries in `--include` starting with `/` to find(1), and all entries in `--exclude` which are not selectors to find(1) using the `-not -path` flag.

```
$ tscli logs collect --include system,orion --exclude *hadoop*,*zookeeper* --since 2h
```

The above command collects all system and all orion logs, but excludes hadoop (hdfs) and zookeeper logs. See [Upload logs to ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/troubleshooting/upload-logs-egnyte.html) about using a secure file sever to collect log files or other files needed for troubleshooting. You can easily send log files to this file serve directly from the ThoughtSpot instance.
