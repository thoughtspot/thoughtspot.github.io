ThoughtSpot comes configured with the timezone where it is to be installed.

If you need to change the timezone, for example when moving a ThoughtSpot appliance to another data center [contact ThoughtSpot Support](/admin/misc/contact.html#), and they will change the timezone for you.

Note that if the timezone was not set correctly when shipped, it may be necessary to have ThoughtSpot Support reset it. This can be true even if the file /etc/timezone lists the correct timezone. Sometimes the timezone that is listed is not the active timezone and it needs to be reset.
