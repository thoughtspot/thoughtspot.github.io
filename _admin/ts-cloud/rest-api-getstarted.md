Before you start using REST APIs, perform the following checks:

-   Your client application domain is added as a [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) host](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=security-settings){:target="_blank"} in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal.

    After you add your host domain for CORS, ThoughtSpot adds the `access-control-allow-origin` header in its API responses.

-   You have valid login credentials and access privileges to run the operations.

-   If trusted authentication is enabled on your instance, you must obtain an authentication token and include it in your subsequent login requests. 

## Swagger UI

To access REST APIs on Swagger:

1.  Log in to your ThoughtSpot instance.

2.  Access the Swagger portal.

    To access Swagger UI, change your URL as shown below:

        https://<your-thoughtspot.com>/external/swagger

    Go to Swagger Portal
    The portal displays a list of REST API services available for the logged-in ThoughtSpot users.

3.  Click on a header to expand and view the list of services.

4.  Click on a service name to view more details about the API service.

5.  To explore an API, click **Try it out**.

## API requests and response

To call a REST API, send a request to the endpoint URL with the attributes required to create, view, or modify an object.

### Request method  
Specify the HTTP request method for the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operation in your request to the API endpoint. For example, GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

### Query string  
A query string consists of additional parameters that are passed in the URL. For example, the `/tspublic/v1/metadata/listobjectheaders` API endpoint requires query parameters that are passed as a query string in the URL.

### Request headers  
-   Make sure you include the `'X-Requested-By': 'ThoughtSpot'` header in all API requests.

-   Set the `Content-Type` and `Accept` header to `application/json` for JSON and `text/plain` for plain text.

-   Some complex POST operations, such as sharing an object with another user, require the URL-encoded objects to be passed as parameters in the URL. For such API requests, use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header.

### Multipart/Form-data  
Some APIs use `multipart/form-data` for POST requests and require you to provide an input file as a payload. To know if an API uses `multipart/form-data` content-type, see the [corresponding API description page](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=rest-api-reference){:target="_blank"}.

### Response body  
For each API request, ThoughtSpot sends a response. The API response includes either an HTTP status code or a response body in the JSON or plain text format.

For more information about the REST API request URL, parameters, headers, and sample response, see [REST API Reference](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=rest-api-reference){:target="_blank"}.
