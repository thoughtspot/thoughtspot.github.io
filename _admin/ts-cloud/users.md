Before people can log in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a
password, and a membership in one or more groups for them. Use the Admin Console to easily create and manage your users.

Refer to [Understand groups and privileges]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html) to learn about the privileges you can assign to a user.

To manage users, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the **Admin** tab from the top navigation bar. Select **Users** from the side navigation bar that appears.

You can use the Admin Console to accomplish the following tasks:
* **Create a user** by clicking on the **+ add user** button
* **Manage an existing user** by clicking on the user you would like to edit: change the username, display name, sharing visibility, password, or email, or resend or test the welcome email
* **Delete a user** by hovering over a username, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the **Delete** button
* **Add a user or users to groups** by hovering over a username, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the **Add users to groups** button

Refer to [Create, edit, or delete a user]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/add-user.html) for more detail on how to create and manage users.
