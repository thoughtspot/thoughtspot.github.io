You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it. Formulas are not reusable; the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to. A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the [Formula function reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#).

You can create a formula in a worksheet by using the Formula Builder. When you do this, the result of the formula gets added to the worksheet as a column. Use these steps to create a formula:

1. [Create a new worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.html), or [edit an existing one]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/edit-worksheet.html).
2. Click the **+** button next to **Formulas**.

3. Type your formula in the Formula Builder.

    **Note:** Formula elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions (blue), the names of columns (purple), and/or constants (black).

5.  You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking on **Formula Assistant.**

4. If you want to change what your formula returns, use the **Advanced settings**.

   Depending on your formula, you may be able to change:

    -   **Data type**: Determines the type of data that the formula generates. For example, use `date` for an `add_days` formula.
    -   **Measure or attribute**: Determines if the output of the formula is a measure or an attribute. For example, choose `attribute` for a formula that generates age groups, and choose `measure` for a formula that generates profit.
    -   **Aggregation**: Determines the default aggregation of the formula output. For example, choose `min` to see minimum profit.

6. Name the formula by clicking on its title and typing the new name. Click **Save**.
