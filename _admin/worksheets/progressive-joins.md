Use the worksheet join rule to specify when to apply joins when a search is done
on a worksheet. You can either apply joins progressively, as each search term is
added (recommended), or apply all joins to every search.

## Understand progressive joins

Often, a worksheet includes several dimension tables and a fact table. With
progressive joins, if your search only includes terms from the fact table,
you can see all of the rows that satisfy your search. But as you add terms from
dimension tables, the total number of rows shown may be reduced, as the joins to
each dimension table are applied. It works like this:

-   If you choose **Apply joins progressively (recommended for most cases)**, joins are only applied for tables whose columns are included in the search.
-   If you choose **Apply all joins**, all possible joins are applied, regardless of which tables are included in the search.

When using **Apply joins progressively**, the number of rows in a search using
the worksheet depends on which tables are part of the search. The worksheet contains the results of a defined
query in the form of a table. So if a particular dimension table is left out of
the search, its joins are not applied.

## Rule-Based Row Level Security (RLS) with worksheets

With Rule-Based RLS, you need to protect every table that contains any sensitive
data. To do this, you can grant access by creating explicit row level security
rules on each of the underlying tables which contain data that row level
security should apply to.

When creating the row level security rules for a table that's part of a
worksheet, you aren't limited to referencing only the columns in that table. You
can specify columns from other tables in the worksheet as well, as long as the
tables are joined to the table you're creating the rule on. Then, when creating
a worksheet on top of them, the behavior is consistent regardless of the
worksheet join rule you choose. Users will never be able to see data they should
not, regardless of what their search contains.

Imagine you have a worksheet that contains a `Sales` fact table, and `Customer`
and `Product` dimensions that are joined on `Customer SSN` and `Product Code`
columns. In order to secure the `Sales` table, you can use `Customer Name` from
the `Customer` column to create a row level security rule.

## How joins are applied with chasm traps

When working with worksheets and row level security, you need to understand how
joins are applied. This is particularly important with chasm trap schemas. For
chasm trap schemas, if row level security is only set on one of the tables,
people could see data they should not see if the scope of their search does not
include that table. (this protects them from having people see the wrong things
if they have chasm trap).

For chasm trap _worksheets_, progressive and non-progressive joins do not apply.
There is an entirely different methodology for how worksheet joins on a chasm
trap schema work with row level security. So you can safely ignore that setting.
