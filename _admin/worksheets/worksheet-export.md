In ThoughtSpot, you can download Worksheets to a flat file in `yaml` format, modify the file, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster. This mechanism supports several scenarios that you may encounter:

- <strong>Migrating from a development environment to a production environment</strong> by downloading the file from the development cluster and uploading the same file into the production cluster
- <strong>Implementing metadata changes outside ThoughtSpot UI</strong>, such as replacing the underlying tables for the entire table, or replacing a single column from one table with a column in another table
- <strong>Making bulk changes</strong>, such as mass renaming of objects defined by the worksheets, and managing duplicates
