It is recommended to use a bucket in the same region as your cluster. By doing this, you avoid additional cross-region data transfer costs.

## Backing up to an Amazon S3 bucket
You can back up your cluster to an S3 bucket either [manually](#manual-backup) or [periodically](#periodic-backup).

{: id="manual-backup"}
To manually back up your cluster to an S3 bucket, use the ThoughtSpot tscli:

1. Log in to the Linux shell of your cluster using SSH.
    ```
    $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
    ```
2. Run the backup command using the following syntax:  

    `tscli backup create --storage_type=cloud <SNAPSHOT NAME> <PATH TO BACKUP> --bucket_name=<BUCKET NAME>`

    Example:
    ```
    $ tscli backup create --storage_type=cloud snapshot_1 my_backup001 --bucket_name=my_bucket
    ```

{: id="periodic-backup"}
To periodically back up your cluster to an S3 bucket using a backup policy, use the ThoughtSpot tscli:

1. Log in to the Linux shell of your cluster using SSH.
    ```
    $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
    ```

2. Run the backup policy command:
    ```
    $ tscli backup-policy create
    ```

3. The command opens a `vi` editor you can use to configure the backup policy, which has the following syntax:

    ```
    name: <backup-name>
    param {
      mode: [FULL | LIGHT | DATALESS]
      type: STANDALONE
    }
    schedule {
      period {
        number: <number-in-integer-format>
        unit: [MINUTE | HOUR | DAY]
      }
      retention_policy {
        bucket {
          time {
            number: <number-in-integer-format>
            unit: [MINUTE | HOUR | DAY]
          }
          capacity: <number-in-integer-format>
        }
      }
      offset_minutes_from_sunday_midnight: <number-in-integer-format>
    }
    directory: <directory-name>
    storage_type: S3
    enabled: true
    bucket_name: <your-S3-bucket-name>
    ```

    You must specify `S3` for the `storage_type`. Refer to [Configure periodic backups]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/backup-restore/configure-backup.html) for more information.

## Restoring from an Amazon S3 bucket

To restore your cluster from an S3 bucket, use the ThoughtSpot tscli:

1. Log in to the Linux shell of your cluster using SSH.
    ```
    $ ssh admin@<cluster-IP>
    ```
2. Run the restore command using the following syntax:  

    `tscli cluster restore <PATH TO BACKUP ON CLOUD> --enable_cloud_storage s3a`

    Example:
    ```
    $ tscli cluster restore s3://bucket0001/backup/my_backup001 --enable_cloud_storage s3a
    ```
