ThoughtSpot can be deployed in your Azure environment by deploying compute VM instances in your VNET, or Azure Virtual Network, and your underlying persistent storage infrastructure. Currently ThoughtSpot supports Premium SSD Managed Disks for persistent storage. For more information, see [Managed Disks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/managed-disks/){:target="_blank"} in Microsoft's Azure documentation.

All Azure VMs (nodes) in a ThoughtSpot cluster must be in the same availability zone
(and, therefore, also in the same region). ThoughtSpot does not support deploying VMs( nodes) of the same cluster across availability zones. For more information, see [What are Availability Zones in Azure?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview){:target="_blank"} in Microsoft's Azure documentation.
