## About the ThoughtSpot image

To provision ThoughtSpot in the Azure portal, access the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine in the Azure Marketplace.

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine comes provisioned with the custom ThoughtSpot
image to make hosting simple. A virtual machine is a preconfigured template that
provides the information required to launch an instance of ThoughtSpot. It includes a root disk for the instance, which contains an operating system, application server, and other necessary software.

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine has the ThoughtSpot software installed and
configured, on a CentOS-based image. Check with your ThoughtSpot contact to
learn about the latest version of the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine.

Due to security restrictions, the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine does not have default passwords for the administrator users. When you are ready to obtain the password, contact
[ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html).

This guide explains how to deploy ThoughtSpot on Microsoft Azure, using ThoughtSpot's CentOS-based image. You can also deploy ThoughtSpot on Azure using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), allowing you to run ThoughtSpot on an RHEL 7.8 or 7.9 image that your organization manages internally. To install ThoughtSpot using RHEL, refer to the [RHEL and OEL deployment guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/rhel/rhel.html) after you launch your virtual machines.

## Set up ThoughtSpot in Azure

Follow these steps to provision and set up the VMs and launch ThoughtSpot.

### Prerequisites

Complete these steps before launching your ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine:

1. Obtain an Azure login account.
2. Set up usage payment details with Microsoft Azure.
3. Find your company's [Resource Group](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups). (optional--you can also create one while creating your virtual machines.)
4. Download and fill out the ThoughtSpot [site survey]({{ site.baseurl }}/site-survey.pdf){:target="_blank"} to have a quick reference for any networking information you may need to fill out. Ask your network administrator if you need help filling out the site survey.

### Create an instance

Create your virtual machines based on the [ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/thoughtspot-inc.thoughtspotvirtualmachine).

1. Log in to the Azure portal.

    In a browser, go to [https://portal.azure.com/#home](https://portal.azure.com/#home), and log into your Azure account.

2. On the Azure portal homepage, hover over **Virtual machines**, and click **Create**.

    ![Create a virtual machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/azure-createvm.png "Create a virtual machine")

3. Specify information under **Basics**.<br>

    ![Specify information under Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/azure-basicsettings.png "Specify information under Basics")

    | **1** | Choose a subscription type from the dropdown menu. |
    | **2** | If your company already has a resource group, *select existing*. If not, *create new*. |
    | **3** | Specify a name for your virtual machine. |
    | **4** | Specify the region in which you are creating the VM. |
    | **5** | Click **Browse all public and private images**, and search for the ThoughtSpot image. Choose the [ThoughtSpot Search & AI-driven Analytics (BYOL)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/thoughtspot-inc.thoughtspotvirtualmachine?tab=Overview){: target="_blank"} image. |
    | **6** | Refer to [Azure configuration options]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/azure/configuration-options.html) to choose a size for your VM that works for your cluster needs. |
    | **7** | Select **SSH public key** and specify a username. Note that this user is necessary for Azure VM creation, but the user does not exist in ThoughtSpot. You cannot log into ThoughtSpot, or `ssh` into the command line, with this user. |
    | **8** | Enter an SSH public key. You can choose **use existing public key** or **generate new key pair**, or [contact ThoughtSpot support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) to obtain a public key. Note that this SSH public key is different from the SSH private key you use later, to ssh into your VM from the command line. This public key is necessary for Azure VM creation, but is not necessary at any later point. |
    | **9** | Choose **allow selected ports**. |
    | **10** | Open the necessary Inbound and Outbound ports to ensure that the ThoughtSpot processes do not get blocked. See the [minimum port requirements](#port-requirements). |

2. Specify information under **Disks**.

    ![Specify disk information]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/azure-disks.png "Specify disk information")

    | **1** | Choose a disk type from the dropdown menu. ThoughtSpot recommends the Premium SSD disks. |
    | **2** | Click **Create and attach a new disk**. Add two data disks. Refer to [Azure configuration options]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/azure/configuration-options.html#thoughtspot-azure-instance-types.html) to see what size they should be. |

### Minimum required ports
Open the following ports between the User/ETL server and ThoughtSpot nodes. This ensures that the ThoughtSpot processes do not get blocked.

   The minimum ports needed are:

   | Port    | Protocol   | Service                       |
   | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------------  |
   | 22    | SSH          |  Secure Shell access          |
   | 443   | HTTPS        |  Secure Web access            |
   | 12345 | TCP          |  ODBC and JDBC drivers access |

   {% include note.html content="Nodes purchased from Azure must be reachable to each other so that they can communicate and form a distributed environment. ThoughtSpot requires that these ports be accessible between nodes within a cluster.  Use your discretion about whether to restrict public access or not for all nodes and all ports." %}

   Refer to [Network ports]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/ports.html) for more information.

{: id="prepare-for-startup"}
### Prepare for starting up ThoughtSpot

_Prerequisite_: To log into the VM, you need the private key that is available in the image. You can obtain this from your ThoughtSpot contact.

1. Obtain the VM’s public and private IP addresses.

   - To see the public IP, click the VM name link. This will show the public IP of the VM.
   - To see the private IP, select **more services** from the Microsoft Azure homepage. Select **Networking** from the list on the left side of the screen.

2. In a terminal application, connect to the VM through SSH.

    Log in as the admin user, using the private key that your ThoughtSpot contact sent you.

    ```
   $ ssh -i <path_to_private_key> admin@<public_VM_IP>
   ```
<!--
   {% include tip.html content="If the SSH key is not accepted or lost, you can reset it by going to <strong>Reset password</strong> under <strong>Support + troubleshooting</strong> on the Azure Virtual Machine page. You can only do this before deploying the cluster." %}
   -->  

3. Update the password for both the `admin` and the `thoughtspot` users.<br>
  The command prompts you to type in a new password, and then to confirm the password.

   ```
   $ sudo passwd admin
   Changing password for user admin
   $ sudo passwd thoughtspot
   Changing password for user thoughtspot
   ```
   {% include warning.html content="If you do not change the password, you cannot log back into your Azure VMs. Your private key does not work after initial installation." %}

4. Update the file `/etc/hosts` with all the node IP addresses for the other VMs
that will be part of the ThoughtSpot cluster.

### Verify storage disks

Verify the existence of your data disks, created in Step 4 of [create an instance](#create-instance), by issuing `lsblk` in your terminal application:

   ```
   $ lsblk
   ```

   Your result may look something like the following:

   ```
   NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
   fd0       2:0    1    4K  0 disk
   sda       8:0    0  200G  0 disk
   ├─sda1    8:1    0    1G  0 part /mntboot
   ├─sda2    8:2    0   20G  0 part /
   ├─sda3    8:3    0   20G  0 part /update
   └─sda4    8:4    0  159G  0 part /export
   sdb       8:16   0    1T  0 disk
   └─sb1     8:17   0    1T  0 part /mnt/resource
   sdc       8:32   0    1T  0 disk
   sdd       8:48   0    1T  0 disk
   sr0      11:0    1  628K  0 rom
   ```

7. Unmount the temporary disk by issuing the following command:

   ```
   $ sudo umount /mnt/resource
   ```

   {% include warning.html content="The <code>/mnt/resource</code> disk, which is mounted on the <code>/dev/sdb</code> disk, is temporary. Any data on it will be wiped if the VM is shut down. You must unmount the <code>/mnt/resource</code> disk." %}

8. Prepare the disks /dev/sdc and /dev/sdd for ThoughtSpot by issuing the following command:

    {% include warning.html content="Do not use the disk <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Any data on it will be wiped if the VM is shut down." %}

    ```
    $ sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
    ```

9. Check the disks' status by issuing the following command:

   ```
   $ df -h
   ```

10. Repeat the steps in this section for each node in your cluster.

## Additional resources

### Create network support settings

{% include tip.html content="All changes in this section must be re-applied each
time after a cluster is created or updated. If these changes are not present, a
reboot of the VMs will not have network access. So when updating these files,
keep a backup to copy after any subsequent cluster creation or update." %}

1. SSH into one of your VMs, using the new password you created for the *admin* user in step two of [Prepare for starting up ThoughtSpot](#prepare-for-startup).
```
    ssh admin@<VM-IP>
```
2. Update the VM's hostname:

   ```
   $ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME>
   ```

   If you are using a static name, you can issue:

   ```
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME> --static
   ```
3. Create `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`:

   ```
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "DEVICE=eth0" > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0'
   ```

3. Modify permissions for `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`. This command allows the root user to retain read/write permissions, and grants read-only permissions to other users.
    ```
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    ```
4. Repeat this process (steps 1 through 4) for each node.
