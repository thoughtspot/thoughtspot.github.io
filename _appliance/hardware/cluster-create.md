## Using the tscli cluster create command
To install your appliance, you must install the cluster using the release tarball (estimated time 1 hour).
1. **Download the release tarball** Download the release tarball from the download link sent by ThoughtSpot Support.<br>
Refer to your welcome letter to find a link to download the release tarball. If you do not have a download link, open a support ticket with [ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) to access the release tarball.  
2.  **Copy the release tarball** In your Terminal (Apple) or using [Winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Windows application), copy the downloaded release tarball to `/home/admin/` and run the cluster installer as shown below.<br>
Run the secure copy command: `scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>`. Note the following parameters:<br>
* `release-number` is the version of ThoughtSpot you have on your cluster, such as `6.0` or `5.3`. `release-number` is of the form `0.0.tar.gz`.
* `hostname` is your network hostname. Ask your network administrator if you do not know your hostname.
* `file-name` is the name of the tarball file on your local machine.
    For example:
```
    $ scp 6.0.tar.gz admin@ThoughtSpot:/home/admin/TS-tarball.
```
  ThoughtSpot recommends that you start the session using [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen), so you do not lose your progress if you lose your connection at any point.
  ```
    $ scp <release-number> admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>
  ```
3. **Run the `tscli cluster create` command** Run `tscli cluster create <release-number>` in your terminal.<br>
If you are using an s3 or GCS bucket for object storage, include the flag `--enable_cloud_storage s3a` or `--enable_cloud_storage gcs`. GCS is GCP's object storage, and s3 is AWS's object storage.
```
    $ tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage s3a
```  
```
    $ tscli cluster create 6.0.tar.gz --enable_cloud_storage gcs
```  
4. **Specify your installation information** Fill out the cluster name, cluster ID, email alert preferences and the IP’s of the nodes at the prompts specified in [Parameters of the tscli cluster create command]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/parameters-cluster-create.html).
5. **Wait for output** You may need to wait about 15 seconds before you see any output. The installer is unpacking files and copying them over to the nodes, which can take a few seconds.

Do not edit any part of the installer file except the sections specified in [Parameters of the tscli cluster create command]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/parameters-cluster-create.html). if you delete colons, commas, or other parts of the code, setup may fail.

Refer to [Parameters of the tscli cluster create command]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/parameters-cluster-create.html) for further information.

Your `tscli cluster create` output may look something like the following:
