2. Pull the necessary security updates.
3. Download the release tarball to each cluster (for online clusters) or to your organization’s mirror repository (for offline clusters).
4. For offline clusters, run the `run_offline.sh` script from the Ansible tarball.
4. Run the `tscli cluster update` command.
