## Prerequisites
Before you can install your ThoughtSpot clusters in VMware, complete these prerequisites.
1. **Download the OVF** Download the [Open Virtualization Format](https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/dl/iWvEqo76Pr/) (OVF) file.
1. **Review configuration overview** Refer to [VMware configuration overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-intro.html) for detailed instance specs.
2. **Create the instance** Refer to [Set up VMware for ThoughtSpot]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-setup.html) to create and launch your instance.
3. **Review required ports** Refer to [Network Policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/firewall-ports.html) to view the required ports for successful operation of ThoughtSpot.

Refer to your welcome letter from ThoughtSpot to find the link to download the release bundle. If you do not have a link, open a support ticket at [ThoughtSpot Support](https://support.thoughtspot.com) to request access to the release bundle.

### Step 1: Run the installer
1. Launch a [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) session. Use screen to ensure that your installation does not stop if you lose network connectivity.
    ```
    $ screen -S DEPLOYMENT
    ```

1. Copy the downloaded release bundle to `/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install` using the following command:
```
    $ scp <release-number>.tar.gz admin@<hostname>:/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install/<file-name>
```
Note the following parameters:
* `release-number` is the release number of your ThoughtSpot instance, such as 5.3, 6.0, and so on.
* `hostname` is your specific hostname.
* `file-name` is the name of the tarball file on your local computer.

    {% include note.html content="You can use another secure copy method, if you prefer a method other than the <code>scp</code> command." %}

2. Alternatively, use `tscli fileserver download-release` to download the release bundle.<br>
You must [configure the fileserver]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/tscli-command-ref.html#tscli-fileserver) by running `tscli fileserver configure` before you can download the release.<br>
    ```
    $ tscli fileserver download-release <release-number> --user <username> --out <release-location>
    ```
Note the following parameters:
* `release-number` is the release number of your ThoughtSpot instance, such as 5.3, 5.3.1, 6.0, and so on.
* `username` is the username for the fileserver that you set up earlier, when configuring the fileserver.
* `release-location` is the location path of the release bundle on your local machine. For example, `/export/sdb1/TS_TASKS/install/6.0.tar.gz`.

3. Verify the checksum to ensure you have the correct release.<br>
Run `md5sum -c <release-number>.tar.gz.MD5checksum`.
    ```
    $ md5sum -c <release-number>.tar.gz.MD5checksum
    ```

    Your output says `ok` if you have the correct release.

2. Create the cluster.<br>
Run `tscli cluster create` to create the cluster.
```
    $ tscli cluster create <release-number>.tar.gz
```
