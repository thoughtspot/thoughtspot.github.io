Congratulations on purchasing the ThoughtSpot instance. This section is an
overview of the ThoughtSpot AI-Driven analytics platform hosted on the VMWare
VSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 6.5 environment.

## About ThoughtSpot on VMWare

The VMWare virtualization platform provides highly scalable and efficient memory
and CPU resources management that can be used by ThoughtSpot instances.
Additionally, the VMWare virtualization environment is an easy transition
between development and production environments. The following diagram shows
the components of a VMWare and ThoughtSpot architecture:

virtual machines are supported with ThoughtSpot." %}

Your database capacity will determine the number of ThoughtSpot instances and
the instance network/storage requirements. In addition, you can scale your
ThoughtSpot VMs as your dataset size grows.

## Configuration

ThoughtSpot Engineering has performed extensive testing of the ThoughtSpot
platform on the VMWare for the best performance, load balancing, scalability,
and reliability. Based on this testing, ThoughtSpot recommends the following
minimum specifications for individual VMWare ESXi VM:

* 512G Memory
* 200G SSD
* 3X 2T Hard disks (6T in total in hard disk space)
* 40 Cores

All virtualization hosts should have VMWare VSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 6.5 installed.

ThoughtSpot provides a VMWare template (OVF) together with a VMDK (Virtual
Machine Disk) file for configuring a VM. VMDK is a file format that describes
containers for virtual hard disk drives to be used in virtual machines like
VMware Workstation or VirtualBox. OVF is a platform-independent, efficient,
extensible, and open packaging distribution format for virtual machines.

The ThoughtSpot VM configuration uses thin provisioning and sets the recommended
reserved memory, among other important specifications. You can obtain these
files from your ThoughtSpot Customer Success Engineer.
