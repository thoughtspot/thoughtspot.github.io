Congratulations on purchasing ThoughtSpot. You can install a ThoughtSpot cluster
on a hardware appliance or on a hosted AWS or VMWare appliance. Your ThoughtSpot
installation cannot mix node types, your installation must be homogenous, so,
for example either hardware or VMWare nodes. You can have an AWS cluster for
development and use an appliance for production.

This guide instructs you how to prepare each of the following:

- [Hardware appliance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/inthebox.html)
- [AWS EC2 node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/aws/about-aws.html)
- [VMWare node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-intro.html)

Once you've configured your nodes, you can contact [ThoughtSpot
Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) by phone, mail, email, or by filing a support ticket.
