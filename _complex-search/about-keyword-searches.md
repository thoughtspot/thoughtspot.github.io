In addition to column names, values, and filters, the search bar also accepts keywords.  You can access a list of keywords and other reference materials in the [ keyword reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/keywords.html#) section.

## Example: Simplify search with the top keyword

 The `top` keyword can be a powerful addition to your search when you remember to use it. By using one keyword, you can greatly simplify your searches. The top keyword is one such keyword. Its syntax looks like top n for each x.

 Some common search examples it can simplify are finding the:

 -   top two performing sales rep
 -   top revenue average revenue by state
 -   top two students ranked by source for each class


## Types of keywords

Keywords serve a variety of predefined purposes, and are divided into different groups. The groups are as follows:

-   **Basic keywords**

    You can use keywords such as `top` and `bottom` to, for example, only see results for the best or worst performing sales rep.

-   **Date keywords**

    Date keywords give you the freedom to narrow your search by days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. There are also a number of date related keywords such as `after`, `before`, and `year-over-year`. Use the new date keywords to describe dates in the future. This is useful for exploring things that are scheduled for a future date, such as shipments due to go out in the next week.

-   **Time keywords**

    Time keywords are the most useful when trying to figure out how many visitors you've received within the last `n minutes or hours`.

-   **Text keywords**

    You can use text keywords to find similar words or phrases that contains a certain word. For example, `product name contains green`.

-   **Number keywords**

    These keywords allows you to define your search by sum, average, count, max, min, and other accumulations.

-   **Comparative keywords**

    Filter keywords work in the same way as filters on table columns or chart axes.

-   **Location keywords**

    The keywords `near` and `farther than` allow you to search with spatial filters on your geo type columns with latitude/longitude data. This lets you focus your search based on distance and locations. You can specify a specific radius using miles, kilometers, or meters.
