{% include note.html content="Formula Editor V2 is part of the Answer V2 feature set. Answer V2 is in <strong>Beta</strong>. It is off by default for ThoughtSpot Cloud clusters. To turn it on or off at a cluster level, contact ThoughtSpot Support. If an administrator enables it for your cluster, you can turn it on or off individually from the <strong>Data</strong> panel on the <strong>Search</strong> page by selecting <strong>Switch to classic</strong> to turn it off and <strong>Try Beta experience</strong> to turn it on. Answer V2 features currently only work on searches and Answers, including Answers pinned to Pinboards. If you have Answer V2 on, the new version of the Formula Editor appears when you add a formula to a search, but not when you add a formula to a Worksheet." %}

You can always go back and view or edit a formula that was added to an Answer. Anyone who has edit privileges on an Answer can also edit any formulas it contains. To view or edit an existing formula in an Answer:

1. Navigate to the Answer whose formula you would like to edit. If the Answer is within a Pinboard, select the ellipsis menu ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-more-10px.png){: .inline} for that Answer and click **Edit**.

3. Open the **Data** panel from the upper right corner of the **Search** page. Expand the **Formulas** section in the **Data** panel. You can see a list of all the formulas in the Answer.

4. Click the edit icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-edit-10px.png){: .inline} next to the formula name.

5. View or edit your formula in the Formula Editor.
