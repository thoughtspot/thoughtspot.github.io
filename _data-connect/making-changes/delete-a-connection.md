A connection is not tied to a task, and can therefore be called in multiple data sources. So in order to delete a connection, you must first delete all of the sources and tasks that use that connection. When the connection is not used in any data source, you can delete it.

To delete a connection:

1. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.

2. Click **Data**, on the top navigation bar.

3.  Click the **Data Sources** tab at the top of the screen.

4. Delete any dependent data sources. To delete a data source, see [Delete a data source](delete-data-source.html#).

5. Select **+ New data source** on the upper right hand side of the panel.

6. Select the connection type of interest and click **Next**.

8. Click the **x** on the right of your selected connection to delete it.
