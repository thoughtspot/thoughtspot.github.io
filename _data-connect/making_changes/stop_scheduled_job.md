Use this procedure to pause or stop a job. There are a few conditions when it may be useful to stop or pause a scheduled job:

-   The source system will be offline for maintenance.
-   You are migrating the data to a new source system, and don't want to delete the original job.
-   There is a problem with the job, and you don't want it to run while you are figuring out how to solve it.
-   ThoughtSpot will be offline for scheduled maintenance or an upgrade.
-   You want to delete the data source on which the scheduled job runs.

To stop a scheduled job from running:

1. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click on **DATA**, on the top navigation bar.
