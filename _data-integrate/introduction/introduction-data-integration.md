This guide explains how to integrate ThoughtSpot with other data sources for
loading data. It also includes information on installing and using the
ThoughtSpot clients (ODBC, JDBC, and more).

## ThoughtSpot Clients

ThoughtSpot provides certified clients to help you load data easily from your
ETL tool or another database. These include ODBC and JDBC drivers.

You can obtain the ThoughtSpot client downloads from the Help Center. Always use
the version of the ThoughtSpot clients that corresponds with the version of
ThoughtSpot that you are running. When upgrading, make sure to upgrade your
clients as well.

{% include important.html content="The ETL tool must add a data transformation
step if the source column data type does not exactly match the target's,
ThoughtSpot's, column data type. The driver does not do any implicit
conversions." %}

## Methods for loading data

There are several ways to load data into ThoughtSpot, depending on your goals
and where the data is located. Always consider your requirements for
recurring loads when planning how best to bring the data into ThoughtSpot.

Here are the options, with information on where to find the documentation for
each method:

      <td>ThoughtSpot Loader (tsload)</td>
      <td>ThoughtSpot Loader is a command line tool to load CSV files into an existing database schema in ThoughtSpot. This is the fastest way to load extremely large amounts of data, and it can be run in parallel. You can also use this method to script recurring loads. See the ThoughtSpot Administrator Guide for details.</td>

## ThoughtSpot server-side setup prerequisites for importing data via JDBC/ODBC 
Open up ThoughtSpot firewall to allow incoming requests to Simba server.
```
tscli firewall open-ports --ports 12345
```
Confirm that process `simba_server` is up. Output of the command below should contain exactly 1-line, as shown below.
```
ps -ef | grep simba_server | grep -v grep
admin    26679 25672  0 Jul13 ?        00:01:49 simba_server_main --logbufsecs=0
```
Please reach out to ThoughtSpot Support Team should you require any help here.

## Where to go next

-   **[About the ODBC Driver]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/clients/about-odbc.html)**  
You can use the ThoughtSpot ODBC driver to bring data into ThoughtSpot from your ETL tool or database.
-   **[About the JDBC Driver]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/clients/about-jdbc-driver.html)**  
 Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java standard API that allows applications to interact with databases in a standard manner. ThoughtSpot has JDBC support via a JDBC driver we provide.
