Before you can use JDBC or ODBC to import data into ThoughtSpot, you must do the following server-side configuration:

1. Open up the ThoughtSpot firewall to allow incoming requests to Simba server.
   ```
   tscli firewall open-ports --ports 12345
   ```
2. Confirm that the `simba_server` process is up. Output of the command below should contain exactly one line, as shown below.
   ```
   ps -ef | grep simba_server | grep -v grep
   admin    26679 25672  0 Jul13 ?        00:01:49 simba_server_main --logbufsecs=0
   ```
