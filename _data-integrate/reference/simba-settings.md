This section lists the properties you can set for ODBC or JDBC connections.

## Setting Properties for ODBC

Not all the parameters Simba accepts are supported by the ThoughtSpot ODBC
clients, and ThoughtSpot has added some properties, which are listed separately
here. All configuration properties use the type String (text).

You can set these properties on Windows by using the [ODBC Administrator]({{
site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/clients/install-odbc-windows.html#) client. For
Linux, the properties are located in three files, depending on the
property  type:

|Property Type|Location|
|-------------|--------|
|DSN|`odbc.ini` file|
|Driver|`odbsinst.ini` file|
|SimbaSetting Reader|`simbaclient.ini` file|


## Setting Properties for JDBC

For JDBC, these properties are passed as key value pairs in the connect string.
For more information, see [Use the JDBC Driver]({{ site.baseurl
}}/data-integrate/clients/use-jdbc-driver.html#).

## Properties Reference

The following tables summarize the configuration properties.

            who are deciding which DSN to use.

            driver binary. In the DSN configuration location, Driver could contain the path to
            the driver binary, or it could contain the driver entry in the registry.

      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><code>IdleTimeout</code></td>
         <td>DSN</td>
         <td>The time to wait for a response from the server, in seconds. This property is
            optional, but SimbaClient will wait indefinitely for SimbaServer to respond to a
            request made to the server unless you specify a timeout period. <code>IdleTimeout</code>
            specifies how many seconds that SimbaClient will wait before aborting the attempt
            and returning to the application with an error. This timeout corresponds to ODBC’s
            <code>CONNECTION_TIMEOUT</code> property and is only used when more specific timeouts, such as
            <code>QUERY_TIMEOUT</code> or <code>LOGIN_TIMEOUT</code> aren’t applicable.

         <td><code>Locale</code></td>
         <td>DSN</td>
         <td>
            The connection locale. If this value is set, it overrides the driver-wide
            locale. For example, the driver-wide locale could be <code>en-US</code>. If the client would
            prefer <code>fr-CA</code>, it can set the connection locale to <code>fr-CA</code>.
            <p class="p">Values are composed of a
               2-letter language code (in lower case), and an optional 2-letter country code (in
               upper case). If the country code is specified, it must be separated from the
               language code by a hyphen (-).

            enables server discovery. SimbaClient will try to make a network connection to the

               With this keyword, you can control the amount of log output by

            If this value is
            not set, the log files are written to the current working directory of the
            SimbaClient.
