This section can help if you're having trouble creating a connection or need to
find out more information about what is going on with ODBC or JDBC.

The information contained here is very basic, and mostly about how to enable
logs on the client side. If you need more detailed troubleshooting information
or help, please [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html).

If you need more information in order to troubleshoot ODBC connections, you can enable logging for ODBC.
-   **[Enable JDBC Logs]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/troubleshooting/JDBC-logging.html)**
