## Create a CSV file

{% include content/csv-create.md %}

Large organizations typically have a data administrator or department the builds ETL processes. If the data you want is in another system, speak with your ThoughtSpot administrator about getting CSV files extracted from this system.

## Formatting the CSV

{% include content/csv-format.md %}

## Load the CSV File

{% include content/csv-load.md %}

## Troubleshoot uploads

Boolean data must use `TRUE`/`FALSE` values. Other values such as `Y`/`N` are not supported.
