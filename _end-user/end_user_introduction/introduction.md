This ThoughtSpot User Guide contains information on navigating and searching data with ThoughtSpot. It will assist you with starting new searches, managing your pinboards, and troubleshooting.

ThoughtSpot enables you to view and analyze your data through a search-based user interface. You can create your searches on the fly by typing them into a search bar, like you do when using an internet search engine. ThoughtSpot makes it easy to see your data, get your questions answered, create interactive graphs, and customize pinboards. You do not need to understand how the data is stored, attend days of training, or know SQL to do these things. Collaboration and security features make it easy for to protect sensitive data and share information safely with others.

ThoughtSpot gives administrators the ability to modify data properties to meet business needs, for example by providing search synonyms for common terms, boosting the importance of a column in search results, or formatting how the data appears. So if you are not getting the answers you expect when using ThoughtSpot, check with your ThoughtSpot administrator to see if some settings may need to be changed.
