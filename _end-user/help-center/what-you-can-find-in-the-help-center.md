There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application
where you can get more help. This page describes some of the ways to get more
help inside or outside of the application interface.

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set. ThoughtSpot releases
new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the
corresponding major release.  This means, for example, that new documentation
for the 6.0.1 minor release version appears in the 6.0 major version documentation.

{% include tip.html content="ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major
release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`). " %}

## Help menu

You can navigate directly to this documentation site on the web by entering
[docs.thoughtspot.com](https://docs.thoughtspot.com) in your browser's address
bar. You can see the documentation for the latest version of the product, and for other versions.

You can navigate to this documentation from inside the ThoughtSpot application
as well. In this case, the application links directly to the documentation
version that matches your product version. Click the help icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-help-20px.png "The help icon"){: .inline} next to your profile, and select **Help**.

![The help menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted-helptohelp.png "The help menu")
<!--{% include image.html file="gettingstarted-helptohelp.png" title="The help menu" alt="If you click on the help icon at the top right of your screen, you can click on Help and open the help menu." caption="The help menu" %}-->

The **Help** dialog box links you to the following:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col style="width:25%">
   <col style="width:75%">
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Link </th>
    <th>Takes you to ...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>How search works</th>
    <td>A short video that explains how to use the <strong>Search</strong> bar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Keywords</th>
    <td>A product keyword reference.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Release notes</th>
    <td>The release notes for your ThoughtSpot version.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>The documentation set for your ThoughtSpot version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Downloads</th>
    <td>A list of software downloads, such as connectors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

At the bottom of the **Help** dialog box, you can see a link to contact Support as
well as the version of ThoughtSpot you are using.

## Information Center
The **Information Center** teaches you about ThoughtSpot through a navigation overview and a series of short videos. You can show or hide the Information Center from the help menu. To show or hide this sidebar for your whole organization, [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html).

Refer to [Information Center]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/introduction/getting-started.html).

## Community
The **Community** link in the **Help** menu takes you to the [ThoughtSpot Community](https://community.thoughtspot.com) website, where you can ask ThoughtSpot experts questions, share your own ideas and feedback, and meet others.

## Learn

Choosing **Learn** from the **Help** menu takes you to the *Learn* center.
The center contains example queries that you can replay to learn how to search in ThoughtSpot.  Note that you can only replay queries if you have access to their data.

Click an item in Learn to replay it in ThoughtSpot. During a replay, you can
click `Pause` or `Resume` or click `ESC` to exit the replay.

Any administrator can add to the items in the **Learn** center. To add a replay, do
the following:

1. Search in your search bar.
2. Select the pin icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-pin-24px.png){: .inline}.
   The system lists the pinboards you can pin to.
3. Select the **Learn how to use ThoughtSpot** pinboard.

   ![Add to the Learn pinboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted-learn.png "Add to the Learn pinboard")
   <!--{% include image.html file="gettingstarted-learn.png" title="Add to the Learn pinboard" alt="As an administrator, you can pin any answer to the Learn how to use ThoughtSpot pinboard, allowing users to watch a replay of that search." caption="Add to the Learn pinboard" %}-->

4. Navigate to the *Learn* center to replay your search.

    ![The Learn center]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted-learnpage.png "The Learn center")
    <!--{% include image.html file="gettingstarted-learnpage.png" title="The Learn center" alt="Navigate to the Learn center to replay a search." caption="The Learn center" %}-->

<!-- ## Search the help in search bar

You can search the help directly from the search bar with the `how to` and `help` keywords.

{% include content/keywords-help.md %}

The `how to` keyword takes you into the documentation only. The `help` keyword
allows you to jump directly into a product workflow. -->

## Expert requests
**Expert requests** takes you to the Expert Requests interface, where you can view your own questions or answer other users' questions.
