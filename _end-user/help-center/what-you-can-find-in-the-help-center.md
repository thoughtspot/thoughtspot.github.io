There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application
where you can get more help. This page describes some of the ways to get more
help inside or outside of the application interface.

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set. ThoughtSpot releases
new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the
corresponding major release.  This means, for example, that new documentation
for 4.4.1 minor release version appears in the 4.4 major version documentation.

{% include tip.html content="ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major
release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`). " %}

## Help menu

You can navigate directly to this site on the web by entering
[docs.thoughtSpot.com](https://docs.thoughtspot.com) in your browser's address
bar. You can see the documentation for the latest version of the product.

You can navigate to this documentation from inside the ThoughtSpot application
as well. In this case, the application links directly to the documentation
version that matches your product version.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/help-menu.png "Help Menu")

From this dialog you can get to the following:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col style="width:25%">
   <col style="width:75%">
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Link </th>
    <th>Takes you to ...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>How search works</th>
    <td>a short video that explains how to use the <strong>Search</strong> bar</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Keywords</th>
    <td>a product keyword reference</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Release notes</th>
    <td>The notes for the ThoughtSpot version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Documentation</th>
    <td>this documentation set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Downloads</th>
    <td>a list of software downloads such as connectors</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Along the bottom of the **Help** dialog, you can see a link to contact Support as
well as the version of ThoughtSpot you are using.

## Learn

Choosing **Learn** from the **Help** menu takes a you to the *Learn* center.
The center contains one or more example queries.  You can only play replay on data that you have access to.

click `Pause` or `Resume` or click `ESC` to exit the replay.

Any administrator can add to the items in the **Learn** center. To add a replay, do

1. Search in your search bar.
2. Choose the pin from the answer that results.
   The system lists the pinboards you can pin to.
3. Select **Learn how to use ThoughtSpot** pinboard.

<!-- ## Search the help in search bar

You can search the help directly from the search bar with the `how to` and `help` keywords.

{% include content/keywords-help.md %}

The `how to` keyword takes you into the documentation only. The `help` keyword
allows you to jump directly into a product workflow. -->
