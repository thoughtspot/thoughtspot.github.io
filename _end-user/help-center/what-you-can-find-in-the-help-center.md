There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application
where you can get more help. This page describes some of the ways to get more
help inside or outside of the application interface.

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set. ThoughtSpot releases
new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the
corresponding major release.  This means, for example, that new documentation
for 4.4.1 minor release version appears in the 4.4 major version documentation.

{% include tip.html content="ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major
release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`). " %}

## Help menu

You can navigate directly to this site on the web by entering
[docs.thoughtSpot.com](https://docs.thoughtspot.com) in your browser's address
bar. By default, the latest version (4.4) is presented first. ThoughtSpot
versions prior to `4.4` have documentation located at
[help.thoughtSpot.com](https://help.thoughtspot.com).

You can navigate to this documentation from inside the ThoughtSpot application
as well. In this case, the application links directly to the documentation
version that matches your product version.

From this dialog you can get to the following:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col style="width:25%">
   <col style="width:75%">
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Link </th>
    <th>Takes you to ...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>How search works</th>
    <td>a short video that explains how to use the <strong>Search</strong> bar</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Keywords</th>
    <td>a product keyword reference</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Release notes</th>
    <td>The notes for the ThoughtSpot version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Documentation</th>
    <td>this documentation set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Downloads</th>
    <td>a list of software downloads such as connectors</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Along the bottom of the **Help** dialog you'll see a link to contact Support as
well as the version of ThoughtSpot you are using.

## Search the help in search bar

You can search the help directly from the search bar with the `how to` and `help` keywords.

{% include content/keywords-help.md %}

The `how to` keyword takes you into the documentation only. The `help` keyword
allows you to jump directly into a product workflow.
