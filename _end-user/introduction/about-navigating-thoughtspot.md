to use SpotIQ, that option does not appear.

{: id="search"}
## Search

**Search** is where you will spend most of your time. It allows you to search and explore your data. Choose your data sources and type in the search bar at the top. As you type your search, results will appear in the main part of the screen as either a table or a chart.

To learn more about this section, visit [About search]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-starting-a-new-search.html#).

{: id="answers"}
## Answers

Answers are the result of a single search. You can save an answer you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal use. Answers are for you alone, until you share them with others.

{: id="pinboards"}
## Pinboards

Pinboards are collections of related search results. You can create your own pinboard or add to an existing one. After saving a pinboard, it can be shared with others or viewed as a slideshow. The **Pinboards** page shows a list of saved pinboards. Click one to view, edit, or share it.

To learn more about pinboards, visit [About pinboards]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/pinboards/about-pinboards.html).

{: id="data"}
## Data

**Data** contains a list of data sources (tables and worksheets). These are usually loaded and managed by your administrator. However, you may be able to import a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) here, if you have the correct privileges.

**Admin** only appears if you have administrator privileges.
