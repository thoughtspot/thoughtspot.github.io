Onboarding enables users to master the key workflows of ThoughtSpot, and makes them productive and capable users in a very short time.

When you create a new user, we recommend that you add them to a user group immediately. Configure that user group to use a specific data source, choose up to three initial pinboards, and specify the text of the welcome email.

## Prerequisites for onboarding ##

{: id="onboarding-valid-email"}
- **Valid emails**  All users must have valid emails.

  To include users in the onboarding process, each user profile must include a valid email address; see [Create a user]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/add-user.html#add-user).  

  To load and validate user information (including email addresses) in bulk, we recommend using Active Directory configuration and sync. See [Configure LDAP for Active Directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/LDAP-config-AD.html).

{: id="onboarding-tscli-configuration"}
- **Onboarding configuration**  Before starting the onboarding process, an administrator must specify the configuration through the [tscli onboarding command]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/tscli-command-ref.html#tscli-onboarding).

## Onboarding Process ##

The key workflows that enable successful onboarding include the following:

1. Configure and save a default pinboard that you plan to use for new users.
   See steps for [creating a pinboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/pinboards/about-pinboards.html#create-a-pinboard).

2. Create a new user group, or edit an existing user group to which new users belong:
   - specify the group name and its display name
   - set the sharing visibility to visible
   - specify the Privileges
   - select up to 3 default pinboards
   - test and customize the test welcome email.
   See steps for [creating a user group]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/add-group.html#add-group) or [editing a user group]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/add-group.html#edit-group).

3. Create a new user and assign them to the group you are using for onboarding. See steps for [creating a new user]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/add-user.html#add-user). You can also add existing users to the group; see

   In addition to creating a new user directly in ThoughtSpot, you can add users in bulk through [Active Directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/active-directory-based-access.html).

4. When the new user signs in for the first time, the ThoughtSpot onboarding process starts automatically and guides them through a few basic scenarios of using the application.
   See [User onboarding experience]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/onboarding/user-onboarding-experience.html).

5. **\[Optional\]** Any user can repeat their onboarding experience at any time. Simply select **Profile** from user icon on the top right corner of the page. Under **Preferences > New user onboarding**, click **Revisit**.  See [Revisit onboarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/introduction/about-user.html#onboarding).
