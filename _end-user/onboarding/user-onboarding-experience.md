When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically and guides you through a few basic scenarios.

Usually, you receive an email welcoming you to the onboarding process at ThoughtSpot.

To repeat user onboarding, see [Revisit onboarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/introduction/about-user.html#onboarding).

## How onboarding works for the user ##

Your onboarding experience begins when you login for the first time.

1. **Step 1: Get Started**  
   The initial welcome screen provides an overview of the onboarding process, and offers a quick video.  
   Watch the video, and click **Continue**.  
   Alternatively, you can click **Exit to homepage** at the top right corner of the screen, and end the onboarding process. This option appears at this and every subsequent step.

2. **Step 2: Recommended data source**  
   This screen introduces the primary data source for onboarding. The administrator selects this source before you begin.
   Click **Continue**.

## Repeating the onboarding process ##

***\[Optional\]*** Any user can repeat their onboarding experience at any time. Simply select **Profile** from the user icon on the top right corner of the page, and under **Preferences > New user onboarding**, click **Revisit Onboarding**. See [Revisit onboarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/introduction/about-user.html#onboarding).

If you are a new user and you did not experience onboarding, please contact your administrator and request that they configure it for you and other new users.

You can always get additional help. As you start to use ThoughtSpot, we recommend that you review [More help and support]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/help-center/what-you-can-find-in-the-help-center.html).
