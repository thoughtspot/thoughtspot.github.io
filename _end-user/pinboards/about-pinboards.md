Pinboards act like live dashboards. They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

## What are pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. When you create a pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the **View** or **Edit** privilege. Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.


## Create a pinboard

To create a pinboard:

1. Click **Pinboards**, on the top navigation bar.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/click-pinboards.png "Pinboards")

2. Click **+ New Pinboard** on the pinboards list page.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_new_pinboard.png "New Pinboard button")

3. In the **New Pinboard** dialog box, give your pinboard a name and description. Then click **Create**.

## Add an answer to a pinboard

Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a pinboard. To add
an answer to a pinboard:

1. While viewing your answer of interest, click the **Pin** icon at the top right of the answer.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_to_pinboard.png "Pin an answer to a pinboard icon")

2. In the **Add to pinboard** dialog box, click the **+** icons next to the pinboards you would like to add your answer to.

   You can also select **Create new pinboard** at the top of the list to create a new pinboard, then add your answer to it.


## Download a pinboard

You can download a pinboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately. Downloading a pinboard works just as it would when
downloading an answer: simply click the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select **Download as PDF**.

## Details about a pinboard

You can see who authored a pinboard, when it was created, and when it was last
modified by choosing **Actions > Pinboard Info**.

## Other pinboard actions

Other pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as
well as actions that you can only perform on a pinboard. Most of these actions
are found under the **Actions** button.

Other actions are available on a pinboard display itself. Some actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover over specific locations of the pinboard.

If you make a change to a pinboard, the system recognizes this and displays an alert message with a **Save
changes** button at the top of the page. Click this button to make your changes permanent.
