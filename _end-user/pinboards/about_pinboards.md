Pinboards act like live dashboards, and are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

## What are pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. When you create a pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the **View** or **Edit** privilege. Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drilldown on the visualizations.


## Create a pinboard

To create a pinboard:

1. Click on **Pinboards**, on the top navigation bar.

2. Click **+ New Pinboard** on the pinboards list page.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_new_pinboard.png "New Pinboard button")

3. In the New Pinboard dialog box, give your pinboard a name and description. Then click **Create**.

## Add an answer to a pinboard

Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a pinboard by pinning it. To add an answer to a pinboard:

1. While viewing your answer of interest, click the **Pin** icon on the top right of the answer.

2. In the Copy to pinboard(s) dialog box, click the **+** icons next to the pinboards you would like to add your answer to.

   **Tip:** You can also select **Create new pinboard** at the top of the list to create a new pinboard, then add your answer to it.


## Download a pinboard

You can download a pinboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately. Downloading a pinboard works just as it would when downloading an answer. To download a pinboard:

1.   Click **Actions**, and select **Download as PDF**.

## Other pinboard actions

Other pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a pinboard. Most of these actions are found under the **Actions** button.
