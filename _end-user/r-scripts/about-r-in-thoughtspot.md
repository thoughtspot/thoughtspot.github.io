R is a popular open source programming language for statistical computing, machine learning, and AI. ThoughtSpot makes R analysis available as a fully integrated feature.

{% include note.html content="Custom R is disabled by default. To turn on custom R scripting, contact your site administrator." %}

## Using R in ThoughtSpot

Users with R privileges can run R scripts directly on search results.

Analysts and data scientists who are proficient in R can create and share custom scripts.

Users can leverage custom scripts and ThoughtSpot provided scripts, run pre-built R scripts on top of their search results, and share R visualizations as answers and pinboards.

This topic explains how to use R in ThoughtSpot both from an end user and scripting perspective, but is not meant as an R primer.

## How to access R scripts

Users with R script privileges can click the **R** icon
![R icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/r-icon-inline-2.png){: .inline}
on the toolbar for any search result (answer).

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/r-icon.png)

From here, you have options to write a custom script, or load a pre-built or
ThoughtSpot provided script.

## Run pre-built R scripts

You don't have to have a background in statistics or be an R programmer to run R
analyses in ThoughtSpot. You can use ThoughtSpot-provided scripts and share the
R visualizations with others.

## Write your own R scripts in ThoughtSpot

If you know R, you can write your own custom scripts, share them as templates,
test and run them on your data in ThoughtSpot, and build up a shared library of
R analyses, scripts, visualizations, and pinboards.

Start with the topic on how to [Create and share R scripts]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/r-scripts/create-r-scripts.html)
to learn more about writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot, including a few
particulars on syntax and column bindings.

To learn more about R programming in general, a good place to start is [R Project for
Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). Also, Anthony Chen's blog
post on [Using R Analysis in ThoughtSpot for Time Series
Forecasting](https://www.thoughtspot.com/codex/using-r-analysis-thoughtspot-time-series-forecasting)
is a nice introduction to writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot.
