To change the colors used in a chart, you can use the color picker from the chart. The color you set is used in:

* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting
* tags and editing the colors

To change the chart colors, you need at least one column in the chart's legend.
If the chart does not have a legend (not all do) and it is a single-measure
chart, you can [{{site.baseurl}}/end-user/search/apply-conditional-formatting.html](apply a conditional format) to change the color. This type of conditional formatting does not work
with Line charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session. For example, when doing a search on
revenue by state, each state will keep its color assigned to it even if you change the search or
chart type.

## Add a column to the legend

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click **Edit chart configuration** on the right.

2. Make sure you have a column in the **Legend** field.

## Set a color through the legend

1. On the chart, click the color icon of the legend value you would like to change the color of.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/legend.png "Legend values list")

2. Use the color picker to choose a new color to represent that legend value.

   You can also enter a HEX value directly.
