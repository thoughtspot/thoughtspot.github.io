To change the colors used in a chart, use the **Customize** menu to dive into the chip for the column or value you would like to change. You can set colors for:

* bars, lines, areas, bubbles, maps, and other visuals on charts
* slice with color
* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting

You can also [apply a conditional format]({{site.baseurl}}/end-user/search/apply-conditional-formatting.html) to change the color, based on specified criteria. This type of conditional formatting does not work with Line charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session. For example, when doing
a search on `revenue by state`, each state will keep the color assigned to it even
if you change the search or chart type.

## Set colors on a chart

1. While viewing your search or answer as a chart, click the **chart configuration** icon ![chart configuration icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-gear-10px.png){: .inline} to open the chart configuration menu.

    ![Edit chart configuration menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/chartconfig-customizemenu.png "Edit chart configuration menu")

2. Click on the color chip for the column or value you would like to change. Editable chips have a **more** icon: **>**.

2. Use the color picker to choose a new color to represent that value.

    You can also enter a HEX value directly.

    Your changes are saved immediately.

3. Click the **X** at the top right to dismiss the chart configuration panel.

    In the following example, we edited the colors used to **slice with color**.
