To change axis, you can click the axis itself. This opens the detail axis customization menu in the chart.

You can make the following changes to the axis:

* [Aggregate](#aggregate)
* [Filter](#filter)
* [Conditional formatting](#conditional-formatting)
* [Sort](#sort)
* [Grouping](#grouping)
* [Position](#position)
* [Rename](#rename)
* [Edit](#edit)
* [Remove](#remove)

{: id="aggregate"}
## Change the axis aggregate

To change the axis aggregation, click the **Aggregate** option in the axis menu, and select an alternative from the list of options.

Depending on the type of data type and other settings, the aggregation options include _Total_, _Avg_, _Min_, _Max_, _Total Count_, _Unique Count_, _Std Deviation_, and _Variance_.

![Change axis aggregate]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-aggregate.png "Change axis aggregate")

{: id="filter"}
## Add, Change, and Remove Filters

To manage the filters applied to the axis (in this example, _Total Sales_), follow these steps:

1. Click the **Filters** option in the axis menu.

   ![Change axis filter]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter.png "Change axis filter")

2. In the window modal, click **+ add a condition**.

   ![Add a condition to axis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-1.png "Add a condition axis")

3. Select the comparison option.  

   Here, the options include _is greater than_, _is greater than or equal to_, _is less than_, _is less than or equal to_, _is between_, _is in_, and _is not in_.

   In this example, select _is greater than or equal to_.

   ![Set filter comparison operation]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-2.png "Set filter comparison operation")

4. Set the relevant numerical limits.

    Here, enter the maximum of `1000000`.

    ![Set filter numerical limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-3.png "Set filter numerical limit")

    Note that if you select the _is between_ comparison operator, you must set two limits: minimum and maximum. Similarly, _is in_ and _is not in_ operators require a list of values separated by ";".

5.  To add another filter condition, click **+add another**.

    ![Add another filter condition]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-4.png "Add another filter condition")

7.  To remove a filter condition, click the delete icon (**x**) next to its definition.

    ![Remove filter condition]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-5.png "Remove filter condition")


6.  Click **Done**.

    ![Complete filter on axis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-6.png "Complete filter on axis")

Here, you can see differences between the original chart and the one with the filter applied: Three (3) of the departments had sales under $1,000,000, and they don't appear on the newer chart.    

![Chart with filter applied]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-filter-applied.png "Chart with filter applied. Only shows 10 out of 13 departments.")

To remove a filter from the chart, click the **x** icon on the filter tile.

{: id="conditional-formatting"}
## Apply conditional formatting

{% include content/conditional-formatting-chart.md %}

{: id="sort"}
## Change the Sort

To change the sorting of a measurement on an axis, click the **Sort** option in the axis menu, and select an alternative from the list of options: _Ascending_ or _Descending_.

![Change axis sort]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-sort.png "Change axis sort")

Here, you can compare the original chart that was not sorted on the _Total Sales_ axis with the chart that uses descending sort.

![Compare unsorted chart and chart sorted in Descending order]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-sort-applied.png "Compare unsorted chart and chart sorted in Descending order")

{: id="position"}
## Change the postion of the axis

It is generally easier to interpret a chart if axes that use the same units of measurement or scale appear on the same side of the chart. In our example, we can best visualize _Item Cost_ and _Item Price_ on the same side of chart.

To change the position of an axis, select the **Position** option in the axis menu, and then select an alternative from the list of options: _Left_ or _Right_.

Here, we move the _Item Price_ axis from the right side of the chart to the left side.

![Change axis position]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-position.png "Change axis position")

You can compare the original chart with the one where the _Total Sales_ axis is on the right, while _Item Cost_ and _Item Price_ both appear on the left.

![Compare charts with different position assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-position-applied.png "Compare charts with different position assignments")

{: id="grouping"}
## Change the Grouping

When two axis use the same unit of measure and a similar scale, we can group them together.

To change the grouping on an axis, click the **Group** option in the axis menu, and select an alternative from the list of options, which are the measurements on the other axes.

Here, we change the _Item Price_ axis by grouping it with _Item Cost_.

![Group two axes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-group.png "Group two axes")

Compare the original chart with one that groups _Item Price_ and _Item Cost_ as _Item Price & Item Cost_. The chart looks cleaner, and clearly communicates the distinct information on each of the two measurements.

![Compare ungrouped chart and chart that groups similar measures]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-group-applied.png "Compare ungrouped chart and chart that groups similar measures")

Notice that the **Customize** menu shows a linkage between the two grouped axes.

![Grouped axes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-group-menu.png "Grouped axes")

{: id="rename"}
## Rename the axis

You can always rename an axis for clarity, brevity, format, and so on.

In our example, it makes sense to rename the axis created from grouping as _Item Price & Item Cost_ to something shorter, like _Item Price and Cost_.

To rename an axis, select the **Rename** option in the axis menu, type the new name, and either click out or hit **Enter/Return** on your keyboard.

![Rename axis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-rename.png "Rename axis")

{: id="edit"}
## Edit the axis

When you choose to edit the axis, you get the comprehensive view of everything that can be changed on the axis: you can **Configure** the axis name, position (left or right), and the minimum and maximum values, and you can **Format** the category of the column, its units, and the representation of negative values.

![Edit the axis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit-axis-options.gif "Edit the Axis")

To edit this axis (in this example, _Item Price_), follow these steps:

1. Click the **Item Price** axis.

2. In the drop-down, select **Edit**.

3. The **Edit Axis** menu appears.

4. In the **Edit Axis** menu, make the changes to the axis configuration and number format:

   <dl>
   <dlentry>
     <dt>Configure</dt>
     <dd>
       <dl>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Name</dt>
           <dd>Change the name of the axis. Also see <a href="#rename">Rename the axis</a>.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Position</dt>
           <dd>Change the position of the axis relative to the chart. The options are <em>Right</em> and <em>Left</em>. Also see <a href="#position">Change the position of the axis</a>.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Min</dt>
           <dd>Change the minimum value on the axis. For example, most charts default to 0-based axis representation for numerical values; this setting overrides it.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Max</dt>
           <dd>Change the maximum value on the axis. Similar to <em>Min</em> limit. </dd>
         </dlentry>
       </dl>
     </dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry>
     <dt>Format</dt>
     <dd>
       <dl>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Category</dt>
           <dd>This specifies the format of the axis measurements. Options include <em>Number</em>, <em>Percentage</em>, and <em>Currency</em>.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Unit</dt>
           <dd>Unit choice specifies the representation of numbers on the axis. Options include <em>Auto</em> (ThoughtSpot uses abbreviations for really large numbers only), <em>None</em>, <em>Thousand (K)</em>, <em>Million (M)</em>, <em>Billion (B)</em>, and <em>Trillion (T)</em>.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
           <dt>Negative values</dt>
           <dd>Specify the representation of negative numbers in one of these formats: <em>-1234</em>, <em>1234-</em>, or <em>(1234)</em>.</dd>
         </dlentry>
       </dl>
     </dd>
   </dlentry>
   </dl>

{: id="remove"}
## Remove the axis

Removing the axis removes the data from the display, but not from the answer entirely. Instead, the column that the axis represents appears in the **Not visualized** section of the **Customize** menu.

![Remove the axis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/remove-axis.gif "Remove Axis for Item Price")

To remove an axis (in this example, _Item Price_), follow these steps:

1. Click the **Item Price** axis.

2. In the drop-down, select **x Remove**.

3. The **Customize** menu appears.

   Notice that the **Item Price** *axis* and the corresponding data no longer appear on the visual. However, the **Item Price** *column* appears in the **Not visualized** section of the **Customize** menu.
