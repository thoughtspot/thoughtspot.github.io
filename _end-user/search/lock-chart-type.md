You can prevent ThoughtSpot from recommending other chart
options or configurations while you search. For example, if you want to view an Answer as a line chart, you can lock that
display and stop ThoughtSpot from recommending an alternative visualization, such as a funnel or pie chart. A lock persists as you make changes to the columns in your Answer, and persists if you save the Answer and come back to it later.

To disable auto-selection of chart types:

1. Pick the chart type you want to use for your visualization.

2. Click the **change visualization** icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-chart-type-10px.png) at the top right to open the **chart catalog**.

3. In the bottom right corner of the **Chart** menu, turn off **automatically select my chart**.
