You can save the results of any search and share these with other people. Your saved searches appear on the **Answers** page. From this page, you can see answers you saved and answers other people have saved, provided these people shared them with you or a group you belong to.

## Apply a sticker

Only administrators create stickers, but anyone with edit privileges can tag an object with a sticker. To add a sticker to an answer:

1. Find the item(s) you want to tag in the list.
2. Check the box next to its name.
3. Click the apply sticker icon and choose one from the list.

You can apply as many stickers as you like to an object.

## Copy an answer

You can make a copy of an answer if you would like to make edits without changing the original answer. When copying, you can type in a different name for your copy.

1. Click on **Answers**, on the top navigation bar.

3. Click **Actions** and select **Make a copy**.

## Other features

At the bottom of the **Answers** page, you can find two additional areas, **SpotIQ Insights** and **Related Searches**. These areas are derived from your original answer and you can select them to deepen your search.
