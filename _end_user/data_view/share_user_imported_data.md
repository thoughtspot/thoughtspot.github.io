If you upload a spreadsheet, you can share **Can View** or **Can Edit** privileges with other people, who can further share them with others.

Data that you uploaded from a Web browser is only visible to you and to the administrator. You can share the entire uploaded table, or only some of its columns.

Share uploaded data by following these steps:

1. Click on **DATA**, on the top navigation bar.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_icon.png "Data")

3. Click the **Share** icon.

7. Configure the level of access by selecting from the dropdown list. You can select:

    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. This enables renaming, modifying, or deleting the entire table and adding or removing its columns.
8. Click **Add and Save**.
9. Click **Done**.
