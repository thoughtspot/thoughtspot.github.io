   Note that if you use multiple tables, you have to repeat these steps for each table.

   Before confirming that you plan to sync a particular table, examine it to ensure that it has the right information: the correct data types, and reasonable sample data.

   For large tables, use the search bar to search column names.

5. Click **Setup sync**.
