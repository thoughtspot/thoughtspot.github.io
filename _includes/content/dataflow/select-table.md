1. Immediately after creating a new connection, the connection detail page appears.

   You can fill out this information immediately, or return to it at a later stage, by clicking on the connection name in the list of connections.

2. On the connection detail page, click **Add table sync**.

3. In the **Add table sync** interface, on the database selector, scroll to select and open the source database.

   Note that you can search for the database by name.

4. From the database, select the table you plan to sync. You can also search for the table by name.

   Note that if you use multiple tables, you have to repeat these steps for each table.

   Before confirming that you plan to sync a particular table, examine it to ensure that it has the right information: the correct data types, and reasonable sample data.

   For large tables, use the search bar to search column names.

5. Click **Setup sync**.
