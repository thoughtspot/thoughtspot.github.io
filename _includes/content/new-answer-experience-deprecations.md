<li> <strong>Browser back button</strong>: you can no longer use the browser back button to go back one step in a search or Answer. Instead, use the new product back button to the left of an Answer name.</li>
<li> <strong>Multiple join path resolution within the formula editor or a search</strong>: when you try to search on columns with more than one possible join path, the system no longer allows you to define the join path within the search. Similarly, when you try to create a formula with columns with more than one possible join path, the system does not allow you to define the join path. Instead, the system now prompts you to resolve this issue and avoid confusion or incorrect data by creating a Worksheet with the correct join path.</li>
<li> <strong>Send feedback</strong>: The option to send product feedback, from the more options menu <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-more-10px.png" alt="more options menu icon" class="inline"/> on an Answer or search.</li>
<li><strong>Client-side summaries for tables</strong>: We consolidated client-side column summaries and headlines from the backend into new headline summaries that come from the backend. These headline summaries are integrated with the table columns. You can pin them to Pinboards.</li></ul>
