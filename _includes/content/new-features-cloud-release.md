<h3>Information Center</h3>
ThoughtSpot has a new Information Center, accessible from the help icon <strong>?</strong> next to your profile on the top navigation bar. This new help menu contains many useful resources, including a navigation overview, several training videos, and links to more help across the ThoughtSpot product, community, training, and documentation.

<h3>Embrace passthrough functions</h3>
