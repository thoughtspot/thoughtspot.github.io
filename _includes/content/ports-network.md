This reference lists the potential ports to open when setting up your security group.

### Required ports for intracluster operation

Static ports are used for communication between services within the cluster. ThoughtSpot recommends that you open all ports within a cluster. This not required, but it will ensure that cluster communication works properly if additional ports are used in a future software release.

If your organization does not allow you to open all ports, make sure you open the required intracluster ports listed in the following table. In addition, a number of ports are dynamically assigned to services, which change between runs. The dynamic ports come from the range of ports that are dynamically allocated by Linux (20K+).
