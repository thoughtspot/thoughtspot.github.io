You can search across all existing answers, Liveboards, and visualizations in Liveboards that are built on worksheets where you have access. Use this functionality if you cannot remember the exact name of a useful answer, do not remember which Liveboard a visualization is on, or if you are simply wondering if someone else already created an answer or Liveboard that would suit your needs.
