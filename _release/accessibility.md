We at ThoughtSpot design and develop interfaces with accessibility guidelines and principles in mind, as outlined in the [Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies){:target="_blank"} and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/){:target="_blank"}, so that users with disabilities have a good experience with our products.

This report covers the degree of conformance to the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standard:
