- A problem was resolved where changes to metadata resulted in rebuilding the search index, even though the data had not changed.

- A problem was resolved where a search was returning an unexpected answer, because the last aggregation performed during execution was doing a MIN() rather than a SUM().

- A problem was resolved where timeouts were causing a cluster crash in some cases when a right outer join was used.

- A problem was resolved where user names were accidentally being sent along with cluster metrics.

- A problem was resolved where the space allocation chart was not getting updated.

- A problem was resolved where indexes failed to build for empty tables.

- An issues with upgrade was resolved which caused the appliance to boot from an incorrect partition causing users to be found missing.

- A problem was resolved where you could not add a column to the search in cases where there was a long list of columns on the Search page. Clicking on a column name caused the column names to shift, such that you could no longer double click on the column name to add it to the search.

- A problem was resolved where SpotIQ sometimes did not return a result unless a process was restarted.

- A problem was resolved where where deadlock issues with the Search service caused indexing to fail.

- A problem was resolved where if the word "top" occurred as a data value, you could not use "top" as a keyword.

- A problem was resolved where periodic backups was delayed.

- A problem was resolved where adding columns to a worksheet and saving it resulted in timeouts and an <code>HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED(401)</code> status.

- A problem was resolved where idle sessions were never timing out.

- An underlying system issue was resolved that caused a saved answer to fail with a read bar error if the answer was created on a relationship(s) which was based on a hidden column(s).

- A problem was resolved where sorting on a primary key column produced duplicates for some values, both when viewing results in the ThoughtSpot application and when using TQL.

- A problem was resolved where after upgrading, some pinboards could not be opened and instead returned a red bar error.

- A problem was resolved where the number format wasn't being honored when the column contained a currency. Setting the format for three digits after the decimal resulted in displaying only two.

- An issue was resolved where hidden fields in source data prevented users from creating answers related to other columns in that data.

- A problem was resolved where drill down on multiple buckets did not apply all date filters.

- An issue was resolved that potentially made ThoughtSpot at risk for Jackson JSON Library Vulnerabilities.

- A problem was resolved where a node failed due to a bad DIMM (Dual In-Line Memory Module), but didn't failover successfully.

- A problem was resolved where data loaded very slowly.

- An issue was resolved where the ThoughtSpot application was potentially vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) . The potential was removed from the application interactions. Any ThoughtSpot API customers will have to be updated to be compliant with this new feature. The primary things that could be affected:

  - Sync scripts that manage users and groups creation.
  - Scripts that use the public APIs to fetch data.

- The easiest way to diagnose this would be to check for the inability of the script to log in to the system. Please contact ThoughtSpot Support to get guidance on the steps to resolve the issue.

- A problem was resolved that caused segmentation faults which in turn caused crashes in a cluster during an upgrade.

- An issue was resolved that potentially made ThoughtSpot at risk for Jackson JSON Library Vulnerabilities.

- A problem was resolved with the <strong>Show underlying data</strong> function ignoring the "last period" filter. This filter is no longer ignored.

- A problem was resolved where the presence of a date bucket filter after a measure column was ignored in query execution.

- Issues were resolved that potentially exposed ThoughtSpot to two vulnerabilities: "Meltdown" and "Spectre", along with variants. These vulnerabilities only applied when the ThoughtSpot application was sharing hardware with other applications, such as cloud deployments. When deployed in a virtualized environment, either on prem or in AWS, the virtual environment needed to patch the OS for it. When deployed on its own appliance, these vulnerabilities should not have affected ThoughtSpot.

- An issue was fixed that occurred when plotting a formula that has either NaN or Infinity as some of the values. In this case, the pivot table treated the first instance of NaN/Infinity and every subsequent value as a single value and plots it in one cell. This problem was fixed.

- A problem was resolved where <code>near</code> keywords returned a red bar error.

- An issue was resolved where requests to update a formula failed due to the complexity of the nesting.

- Non-admin user could still see hidden fields. In queries, these users were asked to disambiguate these even though they were hidden. This problem was resolved.

- An issue was fixed where the installation path was not properly updated resulting in an environment pointing to old versions of <code>tsload</code> and <code>tql</code>. Now, the standard path is updated during an upgrade.

- A problem was resolved where a saved answer from version 4.3 failed after upgrade because they referred to old table names.

- When query has keywords that map to date column and Period Ago date buckets then SpotIQ Insight for that query did not work even though the user-created query succeeded. This SpotIQ bug was resolved.

- When a query had keywords that mapped to a date column as well as to date buckets, SpotIQ Analysis failed for that query. For example, in query <code>revenue in Q1 1992</code> the last part represents date buckets. If <code>Q1 1992</code> maps to a date column then SpotIQ analysis failed. The query itself worked and any answer/pinboard that based on these queries were fine. This problem was resolved.

- A problem was resolved where NPS surveys were appearing when ThoughtSpot was provided through embedded content. This should no longer occur.

- A problem was occurring where upgrade to a new version caused several types of formulas that relied on aggregated data to stop working. Problems were recorded involving:

  - Unique or count not functional when using Aggregated date.
  - Group_count not functional as well.
  - Group_max giving duplicated result.

  This problem was resolved and should no longer appear

- A problem was resolved where ThoughtSpot would throw an error if the query involved multiple date filters on the same date column. This has been fixed in this release.

- A problem was resolved where the <code>tscli ssl set-min-version</code> failed because the minimum value was incorrect internally. The internal issue was resolved.

- An issue with the callhome metrics feature caused problems during upgrade. This problem was resolved.

- A problem was resolved where deleting a relationship failed if either side of that relationship was a worksheet.

- A problem was resolved where Zookeeper reported reaching a descriptor limit. This report was returned in error. ThoughtSpot no longer reports this.

- A problem was resolved where data loaded very slowly.

- A problem where Strict Transport Security was not enforced was fixed. The product now supports Strict Transport Security.

- An issue was resolved where the ThoughtSpot application was potentially vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) . The potential was removed from the application interactions. Any ThoughtSpot API clients will have to be updated to be compliant with this new feature. The primary clients that would be effected:

  - Sync scripts that manage users and groups creation.
  - Scripts that use the public APIs to fetch data.

- The easiest way to diagnose this would be the inability of the script to login to the system. Please contact support to get guidance on the steps to resolve the issue.

- A problem was resolved with the <code>JESSIONID</code> value. Previously, setting the <strong>Remember Me</strong> option on the login page, caused the server to set a new <code>JSESSIONID</code> on the client after the user logs out. This new <code>JSESSIONID</code> was used for the next authenticated user session, regardless of the user's identity. This no longer happens. Instead, users that re-login after setting <strong>Remember Me</strong> are given a new <code>JSESSIONID</code>.

- Dates on the *<strong>Data</strong>* page was corrected so that dates now sort chronologically.

- Previously, the application allowed cookies to contain information related to session state. An option was added to set more secure cookie handling in the application.

- Previously, the login form on the ThoughtSpot application provided an autocomplete feature. Autocomplete is no longer support. Turning off <code>autocomplete</code> prevents intruders from compromising ThoughtSpot from a workstation unattended using a previously stored user ID and/or password.

- Previously, alerts were time stamped with in PDT. This was fixed, now <code>tscli alert list</code> shows alerts display in the cluster's local timezone.

- The system now validates both the format and the size of profile pictures, previously these were not checked.

## 4.4 Fixed issues

These are the issues we fixed in ThoughtSpot Release 4.4.

- Aggregation over group_max returned a red bar error. This was resolved, users can now aggregate over a `group_max` function.

- A problem with editing formulas was resolved where users were repeatedly and unnecessarily presented with disambiguation options.

- An issue was resolved where a bar on the chart label did not match the underlying data. The data was correct, the label was not.

- An issue was corrected where, if one snapshot deletion failed in any fashion, any subsequent attempts to delete a snapshot failed.

- Users were unable to edit a KPI formula if the KPI formula was pinned to a pinboard.

- Users were able to <strong>Select All</strong> for 1000+ items in a pinboard filter. This action was available but not supported and caused users to believe pinboard filters were not working. Now, the option to <strong>Select All</strong> no longer functions when there are 1000+ items in a filter.

- Users were unable to restore a database backup without first renaming the backup. Renaming is no longer required.

- Creating a formula on `cumulative_sum` function mistakenly caused an error to appear. This action no longer causes an error.

- Some installations saw worksheet performance degrade for worksheets with a large number of columns. Users can now set a configuration option to avoid these problems.

- Previously setting both the browser and the ThoughtSpot profile value failed to display numbers and date formats in the proper locale. This problem was corrected. Setting the ThoughtSpot profile to the proper locale results in the appropriate display of date and number formats. It also causes translated strings to appear in the interface where they exist.

- Active directory (AD) synchronization was not working. Moreover, if AD security group had no members in it, then the synchronization did not recognize the group at all. These problems were corrected, empty groups are recognized and users moved between groups now are properly synchronized by ThoughtSpot.

- A problem was resolved where the round function returned a negative zero when it should have returned a 0 (zero).

- Visualizations that relied on chasm trap worksheet were not immediately updated when a formula was changed. The workaround was to manually update the visualization. This was corrected. The system now updates the visualization automatically when an underlying formula is changed.

- On a worksheet with a chasm trap, join between a fact and dimension did not work properly when grouping by a measure on the dimension table. This was fixed.

- Using `safe_divide` and `sum` did not work with formula on formula. This problem was fixed.

- Data connected schedules did not adjust for daylight savings time. Now, the schedules adjust as expected.

- The ThoughtSpot tomcat instance went into crash loop when a generic relationship includes `IS NULL` operator. Now, this relationship no longer causes this problem.

- An ODBC connection between Alteryx and ThoughtSpot was failing. This problem was solved by updating the ODBC drivers to the latest versions.

- An issue was fixed where an unnecessary right-outer join was being applied to row-level security RLS-introduced joins. This situation led to impacts on query performance.

- A problem was resolved with multiple sequential joins. Previously, the proper join path was not used when the fields are pulled from tables that were far apart unless fields from the intermediate tables were also used. Now, ThoughtSpot is able to handle multiple sequential joins.

- Resolved an issue with a chasm trap that used `unique count` on shared dimension. The chasm trap was generating an incorrect query. Now, `unique count` is applied correctly in the final query.

- Previously, a user user that created some row-level security (RLS) rules was associated with the rules such that deleting the user also deleted the rules. This is no longer the case. If a user creates a set of RLS rules and that user is subsequently deleted, the rules persist in the system.

- An issue was resolved where filters could only be edited in the search bar.

- Intermittent, ambiguous red bar errors related to chasm trap situations were resolved.

- The help for row-level security rules was complicated and hard to parse. This text was improved and moved into the Query Visualizer.
