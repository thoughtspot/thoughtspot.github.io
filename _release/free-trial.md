These are the changes we made to Free Trial.

* We fixed the username/password error message when users create a Snowflake connection. Previously, users who entered an incorrect username or password would see a Snowflake IP whitelisting error message. <br>

{: id="invite-others"}
### Free Trial invitation process simplified

We have simplified the process to invite another user to Free Trial. Now, you will be able to invite others directly from within Free Trial, and the invitee will see the Free Trial activation email in their inbox. Users you invite join your group automatically, and can share Answers, Pinboards and Worksheets.

To invite a teammate to Free Trial, simply navigate to the **Setup** tab and click **Invite others** at the bottom of the screen. Enter your team member's email and click **Send invite**.

{: id="duplicate-column-names-highlighted"}
### Worksheet duplicate column names error

When creating a Worksheet, all columns must have unique names. In order to prevent column name duplicate errors, ThoughtSpot highlights duplicate column names during Worksheet creation, before you can save the Worksheet. In previous releases, the **Cannot add duplicate column names** error message did not specify which columns were duplicates. We believe all analysts, including those on Free Trial, will love this enhancement.

{: id="add-snowflake-connection"}
### Add a Snowflake connection

We made the following changes to simplify the process of adding a Snowflake connection:

* By default, ThoughtSpot directs users to use Service Account. Previously, **Use OAuth** was the default option.
* We added a reminder that the Snowflake database name is case-sensitive.
* We added a connection creation checklist for Snowflake.

## April 28, 2021

{: id="countdown"}
### Free Trial Countdown

We added a white banner to the top of the screen to count down users’ remaining days on Free Trial. The countdown banner turns yellow once you have reached your final week on Free Trial. At any time, you can click **Upgrade now** to upgrade to a paid account. The **Upgrade now** link takes you to Intercom to connect to ThoughtSpot.

{: id="simplified-snowflake-url"}
### Simplified Snowflake account name

We simplified the steps to add a Snowflake connection. When prompted to enter the Snowflake account name, you can now copy-paste the entire URL of your Snowflake account, and ThoughtSpot will extract the account name for you. Previously, users had to select the account name from the URL and enter it in the Snowflake account field.

{: id="thoughtspot-connections"}
### ThoughtSpot connections

We renamed ThoughtSpot Embrace to Connections within the product. Now, Free Trial users can access Connections by clicking **Connections** on the **Data** page. Functions like `sql_int_op` that were previously available under **Embrace passthrough** are now available under **Connection passthrough**.

{: id="unicode"}
### Unicode support

We added unicode character matching in Search Answers, extending support to all languages and character sets. You can now search all artifacts that use unicode characters in titles, descriptions, metadata, and keywords, and see the correct results.

<!--{: id="auto-worksheet"}

Starting with the March 2021 Free Trial release, you can auto-generate a Worksheet during onboarding. When setting up a Worksheet through the Setup tab, you can view suggested joins, and take advantage of data modeling best practices, making your data easier to search.

## About Worksheets

Users are often unfamiliar with tables and how they relate to one another. A Worksheet groups multiple related tables together in a logical way. Using Worksheets has the following advantages:

* Pre-join multiple tables together.
* Give a user or group access to only part of the underlying data.
* Include a derived column using a formula.
* Rename columns to make the data easier to search.
* Build in a specific filter or aggregation.
* Give users a filtered set of data to search.

Typically, you create one Worksheet for each set of fact and dimension tables. For example, you may have a sales fact table and an inventory fact table. Each of these fact tables shares common dimensions like date, region, and store. In this scenario, you would create two Worksheets: sales and inventory. The following diagram depicts the workflow for creating the sales Worksheet.

## Generating Worksheets

To generate a Worksheet through the Setup tab, follow these steps:

1. Complete Step 1 of Setup, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}admin/ts-cloud/connect-data.html">setting up your connection</a>.

2. Click Step 2, *Model data and create a Worksheet.* Select *Create Worksheet* in the lower left corner. A list of the available fact tables from your connection appears.

3. The first fact table alphabetically will be selected by default. Choose the fact table from which you would like to create your Worksheet by selecting the box to the left of its name.

   {% include note.html content="After the Worksheet is created, you will have the option to add more fact tables to its schema."%}

4. Click *Next* in the upper right corner. A list of the available dimension tables from your connection appears.

5. Choose the dimension table(s) to join to your fact table and click *Next*. You can choose up to four dimension tables.

6. The joins interface appears, showing a join based on a column of data both tables contain. You can proceed with the suggested join, or click the column names to change the join.

   {% include note.html content="The default join type is Inner, which will yield all search results with matching values from the fact table and the dimension table. You can click the Venn diagram icon to change the join type."%}

7. Click *Next*. The columns view of your Worksheet appears. You may notice that the column names have been changed to make them more easily searchable (for example, underscores may be replaced with spaces).

8. [Optional] Click *My Worksheet* to change the name of your Worksheet.

9. [Optional] Click the column titles to change the names of your searchable columns. You can also click the blue check-box next to a column name to remove it from your Worksheet.

10. [Optional] Click the data type under *Type* to change the recorded data type. For example, you can change a data type like Zipcode from ‘Measure’ to ‘Attribute’.

11. Click *Save worksheet*. Your Worksheet is now available to search and share.

   {% include note.html content="Joins created in the setup of a Worksheet are inherited at the table level. To remake your auto-generated Worksheet through the Setup tab, you must first delete the Worksheet, then delete the joins at the table level."%}
