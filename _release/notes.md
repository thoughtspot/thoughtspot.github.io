## Supported Upgrade Paths

If you are running one of the following versions, you can upgrade to the 6.2 release
directly:

* 6.2.x to 6.3

This includes any hotfixes or customer patches on these branches.

If you are running a different version, you must do a multiple pass upgrade.
First, upgrade to version 6.1.x, or version 6.2.x, and then to the 6.3 release.
