This 101 walks you through a few simple, SpotIQ workflows. When you have
completed the walkthrough, you will be able to use the core features of SpotIQ
in your ThoughtSpot installation.

If you want a detailed overview of what SpotIQ does before you try it out,
first [read the introduction to SpotIQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/spotiq/whatisspotiq.html).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you can sign in to the ThoughtSpot application. To
complete this tutorial, you need the ability to upload a CSV file and use the SpotIQ application.
These features require that your user account has the following privileges:

* **Can upload user data**
* **Has Spot IQ privilege**

Your ThoughtSpot administrator can give you these privileges. If you can see the
SpotIQ option on your ThoughtSpot dashboard, you have access to SpotIQ:

## Get the sample data and some insights

You can use SpotIQ with any of the data in your system.

This tutorial uses a dataset containing a list of sales and movement data by
item and department.

1. Download the [FoodDollarDataReal]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/FoodDollarDataReal.csv) CSV file.
2. Save or move the file to a place on your local drive.

## Upload the data

1. If you haven't already, sign in to the ThoughtSpot application and click the **Data** tab.

2. Click the three-dot **Actions** button, and select **Upload data**.

3. Browse to the sample data file you downloaded or drag the file into the upload area.

4. Choose `Yes` for the **Are the column names already defined in the file header?** setting.

5. Choose `Comma` for the **Are the files separated by?** setting.

9. Choose **SpotIQ Auto Analyze** to build SpotIQ insights.

   Building insights can take time. How long depends on the data you are
   analyzing. The ThoughtSpot application displays an informational message. The
   message disappears after a moment.

## Work with the INSIGHTS list

Each time SpotIQ does an analysis, it generates a set of results. ThoughtSpots
keeps the results until the user that requested the analysis (or an admin),
deletes them. You can run SpotIQ on the same object multiple times. Each
analysis generates new results.

1. To check for the results of your analysis, go to the **SpotIQ** page.

   The **SpotIQ** page allows you to see all results with data you have
   permission for. So the results lists shows **All** results or just **Yours**.

2. Select **Yours**.

3. Look for results from your **FoodDollarDataReal** data.

    SpotIQ labels each result with a **NAME**, **DESCRIPTION**, **STICKERS**,
    and **MODIFIED**. The **NAME** comes from the object that was analyzed which
    is referenced again in the **DESCRIPTION**. The combination of **NAME**,
    **DESCRIPTION**, and **MODIFIED** is unique.

4. Take a minute and review the **DESCRIPTION** and **MODIFIED** time.

   Not every SpotIQ analysis creates results. You can see information about each
   analysis as well as the results.

4. Click the **Analyses** tab at the top of the page.

   Check the **STATUS** and also how long the **RESULT** took to generate. Since
   you got results, you can see that the analysis succeeded.

5. Select the **Analysis for FoodDollarDataReal** and choose **Delete**.

   The information disappears from the **Analyses** list.

6. Choose **Results**.

   You should still see the results for your **FoodDollarDataReal** run. Deleting
   information about an analysis run does not delete the actual results. You
   must delete each individually.

## Where to go next

At this point, you've created a set of insights using SpotIQ, in the next section you
[Review insights]({{ site.baseurl }}/spotiq/work-with-insights.html) you created.
