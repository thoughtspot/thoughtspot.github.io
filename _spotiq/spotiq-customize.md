You've finished the [second part of the tutorial](work-with-insights.html). In this, the third and final
part, you'll learn how you can modify a SpotIQ analysis to extend or customize
the analysis.  You'll edit an insight to customize the chart it uses or modify
the **Search** syntax behind it.

## Customize an analysis

In the second part of the tutorial, you reviewed the first output from SpotIQ.
The outlier insights weren't really that useful. Let's try to dig deeper into that.

1. Scroll down to the outlier section.
2. Select the first insight.
3. Choose the menu and select **Auto Analyze**.

   The system responds by starting a new insight run based on the single chart.
   Each time you request a change to the analysis settings, it starts another
   run.

4. Return to the SpotIQ page and select your new analysis.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-new-analysis.png)

5. Open the analysis and review the analysis details.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-details-too.png)

   If you recall, the first run against this data SpotIQ ran through 20
   combinations and discovered 14 insights. In this second run against one
   table, SpotIQ ran 49 combinations and developed 17 insights. Only 4 insights
   were discovered.

   Running SpotIQ again does not necessarily result in fewer runs or even, as in
   this case a reduced number of insights. It changes the analysis though, by
   selecting the single insight from your first run, you gave SpotIQ information
   it could use to focus the next run.

   Continue with the customization.

6. Choose **Customize Analysis**.

   The **Customize Analysis** dialog appears.

7. Select the **Customize algorithms** tab.
8. Uncheck the **Outlier Detection using Z-Scores** option.
9. Click **ANALYZE**.

   SpotIQ starts a new analysis.

10. Open the new analysis from the SpotIQ page.

    You'll find that the new analysis has the same name as the last one you ran.
    The new results include an outlier and a cross-correlation. You'll discover
    with these new charts a definite outlier `6/30/2005`.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-definite-outlier.png)

The changes you make in this step persist on the underlying data for all your
future analyses. You can unset these values by going back into the dialog and
removing what you set.

## A temporary customization for a single insight

Finally, you might have noticed the thumbs at the bottom of each insight. Use the thumbs up to tell SpotIQ you like the data insight. Clicking thumb's down display an **Improve Analysis** dialog:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-thumbs-down.png)

You can exclude a value from this individual analysis and rerun the analysis. Unlike the **Customize Analysis** action, this action works only on this analysis and does not persist.

Try this for yourself later at some point.

## Modify an insight search and visualization

The lines used in the cross-correlation are somewhat ambiguous. A different
visualization may help in this case. You can also modify the charts you see in
your results. Try this now.

1. Select the menu on the **Total imports, Total value_added by year** chart.
2. Click on the chart menu and choose **Edit**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-edit-chart.png)

   The **Edit Visualization** appears. The layout is familiar to any user that has run
   a ThoughtSpot search or worked with a result. This is dialog reveals the
   **Search** syntax used to generate the insight. You can use this dialog to do
   all the things you would normally do with a search.

3. Edit the search bar and remove `table_num` from the search.

   The `table_num` isn't strictly necessary in the data.

4. Select the chart icon and choose **Line Column** to change the visualization.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-line-column.png)

5. Choose **Actions > Update**.
7. Close the dialog by pressing the **Close**.

    The chart with your changes now appears in the **SpotIQ** list. The outlier
    stands out very clearly now in both charts.

## Present your insights

You can present SpotIQ insights in several ways. You can present an individual
result or all of them at once. You can package all the insights in a PDF. This
is useful for passing a packet of results. Since any insight reflects the
data at a specific point in time, always consider saving the insight as a PDF.

1. Locate the **Actions** menu on the corner of the **SpotIQ** page.
2. Choose **Actions > Download as PDF** from the menu.

   The system downloads a file containing all the insights. Keep in mind this
   file can be very large if there are a lot of insights found in your data.

You can use the **Present** action to view visualizations that appear in a
carousel, and present them as a group.

1. Scroll down to the first carousel with your new charts.
2. Roll over the right corner of the menu to reveal the menu.

3. Choose **Present** from the menu.

    <video src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-present.mp4" width="600" controls preload></video>

    Click through the carousel with the next / previous arrow buttons, or use
    the left side menu of chart names.

Also, each individual chart has a **Download**, **Present**, or **Copy link**
action you can take.

## Schedule a recurring analysis

If you find an analysis configuration that is useful. You can run that
configuration periodically. This is a good thing to do of course as, in a
business, data changes all the time.

1. Go to the **SpotIQ** page.
2. Choose the **Analysis** tab.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-analysis-check.png)

3. Click on the latest **Total imports by CATEGORY_DESC** analysis.

   The **Customize Analysis** dialog appears.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-custom-analysis.png)

4. Choose the **Job Schedule** option.
5. Fill out the schedule to run the job **Monthly**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spotiq-schedule.png)

   Every month SpotIQ will update your analysis with new data.

Keep in mind that SpotIQ jobs take resources in your system. So, you really
don't want to leave casual jobs running in the system.  Go ahead and delete this
latest job. Now that you know how to schedule a job, it isn't needed anymore.

1. Click the checkbox for the job you just scheduled.
2. Click **Delete** to remove it.

## Congratulations!

Congratulations, at this point you've learned the basics of SpotIQ with
ThoughtSpot. Throughout the application, you'll find the SpotIQ icon on search
answers, pinboards, visualizations, and data. Wherever you see this option, you
can click to run suggested or custom analyses, and get new insights on the SpotIQ page.
