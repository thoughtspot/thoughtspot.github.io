SpotIQ is a ThoughtSpot feature that helps you find insights into your data.
Insights are trends, correlations, explanations of increases, explanations of
decreases, and outliers (values unique from what is typical in your data).

Using SpotIQ, you can find interesting answers in your data that you might not
have found on your own. SpotIQ also learns from your responses to your insights.
Meaning, how you interact with SpotIQ results helps to build better results.

## Who can use SpotIQ?

The SpotIQ feature is made for users who are not data magicians; however,
data magicians can use it to do power data magic. This means SpotIQ is for everyone.

If you can see the **SpotIQ** on your ThoughtSpot dashboard, you have access
to SpotIQ.

If you can't see this option, ask your ThoughtSpot Administrator to give you the
**Has SpotIQ** privilege.

## Where to find SpotIQ actions

The **SpotIQ** page shows you all the analysis results in the system you
have access to, these results are called SpotIQ _insights_. You can create your
own results from several different locations in your system:

* search results such as query, saved answer, or visualization.
* tables or worksheets
* data uploads
* SpotIQ insights

The menu items that use SpotIQ have a label that indicates this:
