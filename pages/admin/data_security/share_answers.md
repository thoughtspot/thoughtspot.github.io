# Share answers

You do not have to be an administrator or the owner, to share saved answers. Any user can share them, based on the access levels the user has.

Whenever you view an answer, you have the option of sharing it with others. It will be shared in its current state, so if you have modified the answer by interacting with the table or chart, the modified version is what will be shared.

1.   Configure the answer to look as you'll want it to appear when shared. 
2.   Save the answer by clicking **Actions** and **Save**. 
3.   Click **Actions** and then **Share**.

5. Configure the level of access by selecting from the dropdown list. You can select: 
    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. If the user doesn't have access to the underlying worksheet, they can only view the shared answer.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. Enables renaming or deleting the shared answer. If a user with edit privileges modifies a shared answer, their changes will be saved to it.
6.   Click **Add and Save**. 
7. Click **Done**.
