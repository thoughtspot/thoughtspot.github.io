You can create a bulk filter by pasting a list of values, separated by commas, semicolons, new lines, or tabs, into the bulk filter box. This allows you to easily search a large list of filters repeatedly.

In this example, we will cut and paste values to create a bulk filter. You could also do this by pasting in a list of text values from an email or cells from an Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet.

1. When viewing a table, select multiple cells by clicking and dragging.
2. Right click and choose **Copy to Clipboard**.

4. Click **Add values in bulk**:
