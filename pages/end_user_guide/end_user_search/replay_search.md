# Replay search

You can instantly generate a step-by-step replay showing the creation of a table or chart.

The replay feature shows how to create the chart or table you are viewing. Use it to teach yourself, or take a screencam of it and create your own ThoughtSpot training for your team.

1.   When viewing a chart or table, click **Actions** and select **Replay search**​. 

     ![](/pages/images/replay_search_icon.png "The Replay search icon") 

2.   Then, select **Start Replay​** to view the video. 

     ![](/pages/images/start_replay_end_user.png "Start Replay") 

    The replay will start automatically. You can pause and resume it by clicking on it.
